  </div>
</div>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c011'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'>The old adage, “An open confession is good for
the soul,” has no bearing on my case. I did not
write this book to ease my conscience; but of my
own free will, for my own amusement—and for
yours, too, I trust. I am going to tell you how I
made my money.</p>

<p class='c012'>I will acknowledge in the outset that I was a
fakir of the fakirs, a Simon-pure article. Today I
occasionally run across an old acquaintance, who
greets me with an admonishing grin, and the
apostrophe, “Look at the airs he puts on now;
and I can remember when he hadn’t two dimes to
rub together.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Yes, my friend, your memory serves you right,
but now I have my compensations. I can take my
ease among the luxuries of a comfortable home;
I can lean back on the cushions of a brougham, as
neat a turnout as you will see on the Central Park
drive; I can occupy a box at the opera, or finger
my bank-book, in which the figures are comfortable,
and the balance on the right side.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was ambition for wealth which drove me out
in the world, to look about and hustle; and I acknowledge
freely that hustle I did, in the fullest
sense of the term.</p>

<p class='c012'>What have I done?</p>

<p class='c012'>Rather, what have I not done along the lines of
a fakir’s avocation? I believe at various times I
have handled everything sold on the road. In giving
you the arguments and methods employed in
my different canvasses I have drawn solely from
actual experience and observation, and endeavored
as explicitly as possible to show how I overcame
every obstacle and objection, and attained a flattering
degree of success.</p>

<p class='c012'>For obvious reasons, an accredited fakir would
stand no show in running for public office; but
he runs for everything else in sight, and allows the
public offices to take care of themselves. In general,
he is a happy-go-lucky chap, who sleeps with
one eye open, and dreams of 200 per cent. profits.
He is a solid, windy bluff; an unscrupulous, honest
trader; a rollicking, sober fellow; a truthful
prevaricator; a generous absorber of money; a
free dispenser of advice; a necessary adjunct to a
circus, and not always thrown away at a church
fair. He is the profitable terror of the hotel proprietor,
the mash of the same proprietor’s daughters,
and the life of a friendly game of draw;
always ready to shovel snow in July, or mow a
blue grass lawn in January, if he can, as he certainly
will, make his account out of such occupation.
To summarize, he is a bundle of contradictions—easy,
yet hard to understand; overflowing
with the milk of human kindness, but professionally
hard as rocks. In the way of business, no
game is too high or too low for him to fly at or
swoop down upon.</p>

<p class='c012'>The life of a fakir is not easy sailing. He
strikes many a stumbling block along the road,
and is hampered by many a disadvantage. He
can have no continuous abiding place. He must
move with the tide, and shift his operations from
day to day. The business of this week will be the
reminiscence of next. New fields, new customers,
new fakes; for these he must be constantly on the
alert, and work them to the most extreme limit.
While on the road he is practically a citizen without
a country and a man without a home.</p>

<p class='c012'>This book is not launched upon the sea of public
approval as a literary gem. It is merely an expose
of the tricks and triumphs of twenty years of successful
faking, and as such, without more words
of explanation, allow me to present it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Becoming Ambitious—Leaving Home—Hotel

of Water.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>I was born in the good old State of Illinois, my
birthplace being on a farm just twenty miles out
of Chicago. Here I lived until I was eighteen
years of age. My father was fairly well fixed as
a farmer and gave me as good an education, both
classical and musical, as a country residence
could afford. In those early days
of my life the western half of the
United States was virtually in its infancy, and
all around me, in whatever direction the eye might
turn, new enterprises were being launched with a
view to development of the country. Reading
of these created a desire on my part to see some of
them, and perhaps take my humble part in the
great work of building up the new side of the
nation.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day I would read of a new railroad building
here; another day of a new town starting
there. Fresh sections of the country were being
opened up, with hundreds of channels and opportunities
for making money. The glowing description
of a hundred new Meccas, given by their
sanguine projectors, worked my curiosity to a
very high tension, and the more I thought of them
the stronger grew my desire to get out in the
world and see, and before I fairly knew it my
mind was made up.</p>

<p class='c012'>For eighteen long years (pleasant ones I must
confess) I had lived on the farm, and had never
so much as ridden on a railroad train. No wonder
I thought it high time to get out and see with
my own eyes what was going on in this great,
round world, looking meantime for the niche in
it which I was to fill.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day I told father of my desires and intentions.
He ridiculed my ideas, and, when that was
of no avail, tried solid argument. He showed me
that farming was an honorable and sure profession,
and the life of the farmer one that was both
pleasant and independent. He went on to say
that if I remained with him I would grow up to
be a respected citizen, and eventually become
owner of the farm. If I aspired to political honors
I could obtain almost anything I wanted. I could
be a member of the district school board. At
some later day I might be township trustee, or
even reach the sublime position of a county commissioner.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, no. The seed had been sown, and it was
too late to pull up the sprouted plant. I wanted
to travel and see something of the world. I was
determined to have experience with and insight
into the rugged, rough and rapid side of life—and
I got it. I was just burning up with enthusiasm.
I desired to move around, to expand, to go
out and “hustle,” and grow rich myself, if I
could.</p>

<p class='c012'>I confess I hated to leave my parents and the
good old home, though the conversation with my
father showed me that his opposition would not
be extreme. I lingered around for several days,
unwilling to declare my positive intention, but
awaiting some favorable opportunity and good
excuse to cut loose from the ties of home.</p>

<p class='c012'>Both came. I went out one day with father to
build a shed for the chickens, and an argument
arose as to the best way of proceeding. He wanted
his way; I wanted mine. The controversy continued
until father got mad and shoved me aside,
calling me a d— fool.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was the nearest approach to swearing I had
ever heard him make. My chance had come.
Picking up my coat, and facing my worthy lord, I
said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dad, I have the honor, sir, of being your son.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that I returned to the house. Three days
later I left the farm.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the morning of my departure I embraced
my dear old mother and my sister, and accompanied
by my father drove into “town.” We
stopped at a place then known as lower State
Street.</p>

<p class='c012'>We conversed together for some minutes, he
giving me the usual, good, fatherly advice, with a
“God bless you, my son,” etc. At last he turned
to go, and as he did so slipped a twenty-dollar
bill into my hand, while I could see the tears starting
in his eyes at what seemed to him almost an
eternal parting. I watched the going of the good
old man as far as I could see him, and those were
the most unpleasant moments of my whole life. I
believe, had I possessed the nerve, I would have
taken the first wagon I could find going that way
and returned home.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was in for it, however, and having decided in
my mind that I had to stick it out, this feeling soon
wore off in the light of the strange sights and
stranger fancies inspired in a pedestrian tour
through the heart of Chicago.</p>

<p class='c012'>My first desire was to become somewhat acquainted
with the city. I was not yet worrying
about “a job,” for I had plenty of money in my
pocket. Including the twenty dollars given me
by father, my store of wealth reached the almost
fabulous amount of one hundred dollars, and I
had a strong suspicion that before that could give
out I would become a millionaire.</p>

<p class='c012'>Being from the country, everything looked
grand to me. I bought every fake that was in
sight, and took in everything that came along.
For days the revelry was high. Side-shows and
museums charmed me. I listened to the patter of
the street venders, allowing myself to be “worked”
by every one of them. I patronized liberally the
street musicians, and even dropped a little coin
with the fortune tellers. For a time I lived in this
kind of a fool’s paradise. Then I retired to my
room and took an account of stock.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found I had bought numerous kinds of soap,
many bottles of cologne, and fewer of medicine
that would cure every ailment ever heard of on
earth. I had tin whistles galore, and all the useless
knick-knacks under the sun.</p>

<p class='c012'>I also had three dollars and eighty cents in cash.
When this balance was struck I understood that it
was time for serious work to begin. I threw
away the whole batch of impracticable accumulations
and began to hunt round for something
to do.</p>

<p class='c012'>After “looking around” all day, and meeting
with many rebuffs, I succeeded in getting a job in
a hotel as a sort of all-round rustler.</p>

<p class='c012'>Being a strong country lad the heavy work all
fell to my share; and I want to tell you right now
that before the second day was over I fully realized
what it was to be away from home, and
thrown out into the world upon my own resources.
I was made to handle heavy baggage, carry water
and coal, and do a thousand other things for
which my main capacity was strength and awkwardness.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was guyed by every one and given nicknames
of every sort. Some would call me “Sport;”
others, “Snipes,” “Jiggers,” “His Nibs,” while all
ordered me around as if I were really and truly a
nobody, instead of the son of a well-to-do farmer
not over twenty miles away.</p>

<p class='c012'>I slept in a large inside room upstairs with the
rest of the male help, which was all packed in together,
colored, white and all. The other boys
took it good naturedly, and I was forced to. My
salary was the enormous sum of two dollars and
fifty cents a week, which was increased a little by
the “tips” I occasionally received. Unfortunately
for me, the boys around the hotel taught me how
to shoot dice, play poker and seven-up, and even
flip-at-the-crack. At none of these games was I
a success, and at the end of the month it was a certainty
that I would be “busted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After a few months of this I was brought to my
senses, however, and decided to quit the hotel
business, since, for me, there was no money in it,
and little prospect of promotion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Traveling men had patronized the hotel quite
liberally, and I had always marked them as a lot of
jolly, happy-go-lucky fellows, whose every pocket
seemed to be lined with gold. Ah, if I could only
be one of them and get on the road! If some
house would furnish me a line of samples and start
me out, then I, too, could wear good clothes, have
plenty of money, order some poor fools around in
the way I had been ordered, and perhaps make my
mark in the world. I thought then that the only
man in the world was the drummer (and I think
so yet for that matter).</p>

<p class='c012'>Unfortunately, try as I might, I found no way
to break into the ranks. The managers of every
wholesale house I went to laughed at me. When
I asked for a position the jobber would always inquire
who I had been with and what I was doing
at present. When I answered that I was first assistant
porter and commander-in-chief of the
water and coal conveying department of the Robber
Roost Hotel, they would smile and say, “No,
my son; I’m sorry, but I can’t do anything for you
today.” You see, I had neither experience, reputation
nor references.</p>

<p class='c012'>In addition to my personal explorations I
scanned the want columns of the daily papers, in
the hope of finding something which would suit
my case. One day I read the following ad.:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Wanted</i>—A young man to canvass and sell
our new line of calling cards. Every lady wants
them and buys them on sight. Large sample outfit
free. $15.00 per week easily made.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To make a long story short, I called at once
and made arrangements with the firm to sell calling
cards. In this way I received my first real
start in life, and was initiated into the ranks of
Fakirdom.</p>

<p class='c012'>The nature of my arrangement with the card
firm amounted to about this. They were to furnish
samples, I was to solicit orders, collect cash
as the order was taken, turn over half of the
money to them, keeping the other half myself, and
they were to fill orders as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c012'>Well, I started out the following morning, and
I’ll never forget that day as long as I live. I went
clear to the outskirts of the city and rang my first
door bell.</p>

<p class='c012'>The lady of the house answered in person, and
when she faced me I had neither nerve nor courage
to explain my business. I began to grow red
in the face and nervous. I weakly asked for a
glass of water, which I drank, and then departed.
I had the same experience at the next house, and
after drinking twelve glasses of water went back
to my room, disgusted with myself and everybody
else.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the afternoon I screwed my courage up a
few notches higher and went out again, with the
determination to do or die. I knew I had a fine
line of cards, and the boss told me they would sell
themselves. I vowed that at least they should
have a chance. I showed them to a few ladies, and
finally succeeded in taking my first order, for
twenty-five cents. With that I felt encouraged,
and went after them right. I did one dollar and
twenty cents worth of business that afternoon,
making sixty cents for myself. Just think of it.
A man in the heart of Chicago, with his fortune
all to make, and after walking his legs off all day,
coming in at night with sixty cents as his portion,
and board to pay out of it at that.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the ice had been broken; the plunge had
been made, and I was proud and happy over the
result. I stuck to the card business for some
months, finally getting so I could make from one
to two dollars a day at it.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day I chanced to fall into conversation
with a lightning rod agent, who had taken a room
in the house where I boarded. In a short time
we struck up quite a friendship, and he proposed
that I should travel with him. In consideration
of my services, which would be only in helping
him put up the rods, he agreed to pay all my expenses,
teach me the business, and allow me to sell
calling cards on the side.</p>

<p class='c012'>I accepted, and here let me say that I never fully
realized what a truly typical lightning rod agent
was until I started out with this man. I had
heard of them, and remembered that my father
was trimmed up to the tune of a couple of hundred
dollars by one, but I never understood the breadth
of intellect, fertility of resource and depths of
trickery displayed in the legitimate pursuit of this
vocation until I had obtained an inside view of the
game.</p>

<p class='c012'>I traveled with Mr. Carlysle for a long while,
working the country, and the towns as we passed
through them. As this is to be largely a record of
my own personal performances, I shall not give
the details of this trip, except that I learned all
that was going, which was a great deal. At the
end of it we were on our way to Davenport, Iowa.
I was getting tired of the business, and intended
to quit when we reached that destination. I had
twenty-three dollars in cash to show for my seven
months’ work, and figured on fixing myself up a
little and looking for a job. I could not travel and
sell calling cards exclusively, since there was not
enough in it to justify the expense, and I thought
it high time for me to look around for some
broader and more profitable field.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just as we got within a mile of the city our
horse shied at a runaway team and Mr. Carlysle
was thrown out of the wagon, run over, and both
legs broken. He was taken into the city; and
hotel, doctor and medicine bills broke us both as
flat as anything you ever saw.</p>

<p class='c012'>I tried to get a job, but could not find a thing.
I was known as the lightning rod agent’s friend,
and no one would have me at any price. It seemed
as though every one there had a dread, or horror,
of a lightning rod man and all his belongings.
Mr. Carlysle was taken to the charity hospital,
while I was turned out of the hotel to hustle the
best I could.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just imagine! There I was, a perfect stranger,
not knowing a soul, hundreds of miles from home,
without a cent in my pocket, and unable to get a
thing to do.</p>

<p class='c012'>Should I become a tramp, begging at back
doors for handouts of broken victuals; or would
it be best to starve and be done with it? One way
or the other, it looked as though these questions
would soon have to be settled.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Busted—Soap Signs—Walking—The Two
Actors—Free Theatres—Jumping Bills—The
Other Fakir—Pen Scheme—Street
Talk—The Friendly Haystack.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>Every man who has ever rustled on the road has
had his experiences with that peculiar disease
known as shortness of cash. I believe I have been
“busted” more times than any other man on earth;
and I am sure that the disease never elsewhere
struck me with half the stunning force then it did
when adrift and alone in the streets of Davenport.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was positively my first experience of the kind.
At home it was nothing strange to have an empty
pocket from one week’s end to another; but what
of that? Board was free, and a roof-tree overhead,
while the paternal pocket was ready to respond
to any demands within reason. In Chicago
my finances had been perilously near to low water
mark, but that needed to cause no uneasiness. A
walk of a day and I could be feasting on the fatted
calf.</p>

<p class='c012'>But to be stranded in Davenport was a different
matter. I remember, in the midst of my troubles,
there popped into my head an old couplet, learned
in my days at the public school:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take heart, nor of the laws of fate complain;
Though now it be cloudy, it will clear up again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that in my mind I took on a moral brace
and marched down the street, willing to meet fate
half way, and looking for something to do that
might show a profit, however small.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Had I not been cut out by nature, and the special
design of Providence for the vocation which
I have so successfully followed, it is more than
likely I would have sat down, with my head on my
hands, and wept. I confess I felt like it for a moment.
When I had resolutely thrust such weakness
out of my mind, and taken a calmer view of
the situation, I saw a glimmer of light ahead.</p>

<p class='c012'>A miserably written placard in a store window
furnished the inspiration.</p>

<p class='c012'>In my early school days if there was any one
thing I excelled in it was penmanship, and with
decent opportunity, and a propulsion in such direction,
I might have made a fair draughtsman, or
a very decent sign painter. Whether I would have
made a fortune or not is another question.</p>

<p class='c012'>At this moment of distress I remembered some
“work” I had seen done in Chicago by a traveling
“artist,” and that for the sake of amusement I had
tried my hand at it for an hour. I went back to
the hotel, and begged or borrowed a piece of soap.
Then I worked store after store for sign work,
promising to put up a magnificent one on each
window, done in soap froth, for the inconsiderable
sum of ten cents.</p>

<p class='c012'>The thing was new to the most of them, and
perhaps curiosity helped me. I was curious myself
to know what I could do; and am not sure
whether I was glad or sorry when the first merchant
told me to fall to work.</p>

<p class='c012'>But at it I went. A dozen strokes gave me confidence,
and half a dozen jobs gave me skill. I
made one dollar during the rest of the day, and
two and a half the next. I lived on crackers and
cheese the whole time, and cleaned the windows of
a livery barn for permission to sleep in the office.
The third day I had apparently exhausted the
field, business fell off, and I determined to leave
the town.</p>

<p class='c012'>First, I went to the hospital, to take leave of
Mr. Carlysle, and tried to force on him a share of
my earnings. He refused, as at present he was
well taken care of, and expected a small remittance
in a few days, when he hoped to be sufficiently
recovered to leave the city and attend to
some business which would probably net him a
little money. Bidding him good-bye, I slung my
budget on my back and took to the ties, without
any fair idea of where I was going or what I
should do. I had a cash capital of three or four
dollars in my pocket, and the art of making soap-foam
signs at my fingers’ ends. I had also heard
of a pressing want for laborers in a construction
gang which was working on an intersecting railroad,
and if the worst came to the worst I was
able to handle a shovel or pick against the best of
them. I was not brought up on a farm for nothing.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sign business stayed with me fairly well.
Even the smallest towns were willing to pay for
an exhibition of my skill, and hard times soon developed
a faculty for economical living. I cleared
my expenses, at least, and some days did a trifle
more. Of course, this was better than nothing,
but was not satisfactory to my ambition. At such
a rate fortune was a long way off, and it seemed
to me the time was about ripe for something else,
even though it should turn out to be no better.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I once began to look about me it was not
long before the something else turned up. I followed
the railroad track, to make sure of good
walking, and on the ties one morning I fell in with
a couple of actors, whose finances were even at a
lower ebb than mine. They were all-round variety
people, and had their musical instruments with
them, but there was not a cent of money in the
whole outfit.</p>

<p class='c012'>It did not take long for us to fraternize, especially
as I carried a store of cold victuals which,
at a pinch, might serve as a lunch for all of us. At
noon we stopped at a spring in the shade of the
woods, and, after making a moderate meal, put
our heads together in a consultation as to the
future.</p>

<p class='c012'>The men were somewhat acquainted with this
part of the country, and spoke of a small town a
short distance ahead, where a hall could be obtained
at a very moderate expense. We decided,
if possible, to arrange for the use of this hall on
sharing terms, and give a grand, free entertainment,
to be interspersed with a collection.</p>

<p class='c012'>We all “managed” the venture. By this time
I had rubbed off quite a large percentage of the
moss with which I was ornamented when first
making my entrance into public life, and had wit
enough to conceal a total ignorance of the show
business and its possibilities. We arranged for
the hall, on the percentage plan, and advertised
ourselves by a little playing and singing on the
street, an occasional blast from the horn that one
of the party could really use in a rather creditable
manner, and an announcement which I made at
the top of my voice, and as near after the manner
of a side-show “blower,” as I knew how:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Free entertainment this evening at eight thirty,
at Bixley’s Hall. Fun by the barrel and music by
the cord. Singing and dancing by the world renowned
Milton Brothers, and an afterpiece that
will split your side. Leave your buttons at home
if you don’t want them busted; and don’t get your
measure taken for a new suit of clothes until the
show is over. You are bound to laugh and grow
fat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This, and other nonsense, I howled out at the
top of my voice, and before I had been at it a quarter
of an hour “the Milton Brothers” wanted to
know with what show I had last been hitting the
road. They had a curiosity to know who else was
stranded. You may be certain I did not give myself
away, and yet I returned a fairly satisfactory
answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>Had we charged even a nickel I doubt if we
could have drummed up the skeleton of an audience;
but for a free entertainment—it was immense.
The people came in crowds, and responded
nobly when the “deacon” passed the hat.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is all the difference in the world in towns
and the crowds you gather in them. This crowd
was willing to be amused, came to be amused, and
had made up its mind not to be disappointed.
They were with us from start to finish, and when
we “counted up the house” found the collection
amounted to within a fraction of twenty dollars.
After paying for the hall, and some little incidental
expenses, we had remaining about three
dollars and a half apiece, and a large stock of confidence
in the future.</p>

<p class='c012'>That party was a wise one in its day and generation.
The weather was delightful, the roads
good, the moon near to full; for these reasons, and
others, we took a promenade after the show was
out. In other words, we saved the expense of a
hotel bill, and went on to the next town, getting
what rest we wanted in a friendly haystack along
the road. While the Milton Brothers’ combination
lasted we paid the hotels less money, and
lived better, than I had thought possible. We had
generally got in too late for dinner, and an order
for supper was enough to insure the moral support
of the landlord. Probably he was disappointed
that he did not see the color of our money, but
that was no matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>The business was grand while it lasted, and I
continued to be a showman for some time. We
went from town to town, walking when the distance
was not too great, riding in
box-cars sometimes, giving entertainments
similar to the first, occupying halls
when we could get them, but content with
an empty store or dining room in the hotel at
which we temporarily stopped. Sometimes, of
course, there was very little profit, but oftener
there was a fair dividend. Before long we had accumulated
at least twenty dollars apiece. Passing
through a large town, we succeeded in getting
hold of a quantity of old lithographs and pictorial
sheets. With these posters and a few small
streamers and dodgers we billed a smaller town
not far away for a “Grand Theatrical Entertainment,”
charging regular prices of admission.</p>

<p class='c012'>Success was with us. After counting up the
house, and deducting expenses, we found we were
on the sunny side of fifty dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such a result as this was too much for us. We
began to think that our time had come. Bob Milton
talked of telegraphing for “people” to join us
on ahead; and all of us figured up the cost of putting
a show on the road that would carry eight or
ten actors, and play the larger towns.</p>

<p class='c012'>Had I even imagined myself born to the buskin,
I suppose I would have taken up with the idea as
enthusiastically as anyone. Fortunately, the footlights
had never cast their glamour over me, and
I had always regarded this venture as a makeshift
and a stepping-stone. When I had done a few
sums in addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division, I suggested that the time was hardly ripe
for such a scheme. We were doing very well as it
was, among the smaller towns, where theatres had
no season, and the population could not, and
would not, support a regular company. As for
playing the larger towns, I did not believe it could
be done for a month yet; and, meanwhile, if we
tried it, we would have abundant opportunity to
drop our little capital and become hopelessly involved.
I thought it would be the part of wisdom
to keep on as we had been doing, playing on velvet,
and week by week adding to our slender
store; otherwise, I thought I could retire from the
show business.</p>

<p class='c012'>To this view the boys finally and grumblingly
consented, after having obtained my consent, by
way of compromise, to hiring a hall at a fair-sized
town not far away, and trying again the
racket of a fine entertainment.</p>

<p class='c012'>I think I had a presentment of failure, and presentments
are not things to be trifled with.
Surely, nothing ever fell quite so flat as that
night’s work. We had to procure a license, we
had to put up five dollars in advance on the hall
rent, our hotel bill was of respectable proportions,
there were other incidental expenses—and we
gave no show at all. There was no gang at the
door that night, no rush for the front seats, no
audience, no money, no nothing. A dozen boys
and men presented themselves at the door, but the
most of them were dead-heads. They filed dismally
into the hall, and filed more dismally out
again. The “house remained dark” after all. The
Miltons concluded that it was more profitable to
dismiss the audience and immediately “skip by the
light of the moon” than to remain and wrestle
with such complications as the balance of the hall
rent, the hotel bill, and other like troubles which
fate might send them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Though the venture had made considerable inroad
on our capital, I cannot say that I was particularly
cast down, being full of that exhilaration
which comes from the ability and the right to say,
“I told you so.” I objected, moreover, to the
shirking of a bill which we had the means to pay
without its causing us any serious financial embarrassment.
Also, I was interested in the possible
cause of our failure, which was a street fakir,
whose harangue I had heard from the doorway of
the hall, where I was in attendance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Up to this time any little efforts I had made
upon the lines which I have so long followed with
such great success, had been addressed to the individual
rather than to the crowd. I had heard
street talkers, to be sure, but had never analyzed
their methods, or thought seriously of following
the profession.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had wit of my own, however, and from the
moment this fellow set up his stand I recognized
the finger of destiny, and made the most of my
opportunity. He was an orator in his way, and
I can not do better here than to give the sum and
substance of a discourse which put much money in
his purse, and wrecked the Milton Theatrical
Combination.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was selling pens.</p>

<p class='c012'>The article was good enough of its kind, and
one probably familiar to the reader. It was brass,
but looked like gold, and so flexible that it could
stand any sort of abuse, except continuous writing,
without being harmed in the least.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had his little folding, three-legged stand, a
torch, and a rough piece of board. He would rub
the point of the pen up and down and jab it into
the rough surface of the board, spread the points
apart, put them together again, and then, filling
it with ink, write and shade as artistically as you
please. All the time he was so maltreating the
poor pen he was keeping up a running fire of talk:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hey there, everybody! Come right this way.
There is plenty of time. The show won’t open for
half an hour, and meanwhile I want the chance to
do you good. I would like to give away lots of
money—fives, tens, twenties, fifties—everything
up to a hundred dollar bill. I’m a down-town,
Eastern Yankee millionaire, and I’ve got more
money than I know what to do with. If you’ll
lend me your attention for a few moments I’ll
make every mother’s son of you rich and happy—in
your mind at least.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here is a little article known as the automatic,
Goldentine pen. It reads, writes and talks in
sixty-four different languages, and is one of the
handiest little articles you ever gazed on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is small, gentlemen, but one of the toughest
little staples that was ever brought into the world
to bless mankind.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the first place, I will ask some gentleman
from the audience to select a pen from the box.
Any one in the lot will do. They are all exactly
alike, so it makes no difference which one you
take. Ah, thank you, sir. Now, I will take this
pen, place it in this handsome penholder, and then
rub the point up and down on this rough, pine
board, in this manner, just as you would a stick.
That should be a good enough test to convince
anyone, but we will not stop at that. I’ll take the
little pen and stick it into the board, just as though
it was a knife-blade. And not only that. I’ll take
the little points of the pen and bend them apart
till they have the appearance of just getting over a
drunk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know it looks hard to so abuse a little thing
like this—but like a careful curator, we’ll just
place the points back in their original position
like this, stick the little pen in the ink like that,
just as though nothing had ever happened to it.
There is its work on the paper. You saw it done
or you wouldn’t have believed it. Is it not beautiful?
The lines are fine enough, and graceful
enough, to satisfy the dreams of an artist—‘fair
as the sun, clear as the moon, gentlemen, and beautiful
as an army with banners.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you want to write cross-eyed, or left-handed,
it works just the same; and when it comes
to German, French, Spanish, Danish, Irish,
Scotch, Latin or Choctaw, the employment is
identical. If you wish to come up and try before
you buy, you are at perfect liberty to do so.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have here, also, a stock of beautiful silver-nickel
penholders, that cost you a quarter the
world over, and I couldn’t sell them to you at any
less. As a special inducement for your patronage,
I’ll make this proposition:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Every man who buys a box of pens, one dozen
in a box, gets two of these elegant holders, free,
gratis, without cost or consideration. Who is the
first man to pass up a quarter?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurry up, gentlemen, I’ve only got about ten
more minutes to talk to you before the show begins.”
(The wretch was perhaps postponing the
beginning of that show until the outer end of eternity,
for there was a suspicion in the crowd that
he belonged to it, and that nothing would be done
in the hall until he ceased talking outside.) “If
you came to me after that and offered me fifty
dollars for a single pen I wouldn’t sell to you.
Live and let live is my motto, and I never would
do anything to interfere with another man’s business.
It is probably the first, last and only time in
your lives that you will have the chance to buy the
Automatic, Indestructible, Goldentine Pen at any
such figures, and if you go to your jeweler he will
charge you a dollar and a half or two dollars for
an article not half so good. Where are—ah, yes.
Here they come, here they come. Don’t crowd so,
my friends, I’ll get around to you all by and by.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That was the substance of his opening oration,
but he had jokes by the dozen and could hold the
crowd at will. I am not sure but that the first
purchasers were dummies, as the boys who came
and broke the ice had a sheepish look; but the ice
was fairly broken, and for quite a while he drove
a roaring trade.</p>

<p class='c012'>By the time I had got from under his hypnotic
spell, my late companions were a mile or more out
of town, and I was once more free to follow my
own inclination and devices.</p>

<p class='c012'>What of that? This time I was not busted, and
I saw glimpses of a promising land ahead.</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not allow myself to be troubled over the
disappearance of the other members of the Milton
Combination. In such an affair every tub has to
stand on its own bottom, and I had no visible baggage
which the hall owner could attach, or any
irate landlord claim as his own until all scores
were paid.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went around to the hotel and coolly informed
the proprietor that the manager and his partner
had skipped, leaving my salary unpaid, but that,
fortunately, I had enough to settle my own modest
bill for the night, and that if he chose I would
pay it then and there. Despite his ill humor over
the loss of a few dollars, I think I must have succeeded
in arousing his sympathy, for he touched
my purse but lightly, and treated me pleasantly
enough.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is quite possible I would have gone with the
rest of the Combination, or started out on a moon-light
journey by myself, had it not been that I
wanted to see more of that fakir. I knew now that
he was stopping at the same hotel, and thought I
recognized in him a kindred spirit, with whom it
might be well to confer. He came in half an hour
or so after I did, and, being in high good humor
over his evening’s work, I did not find him at all
hard to approach.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, at the outset, I was cautious about letting
him see my motive, and I opened the conversation
by saying in a jocular manner that I had to
thank him for breaking up our show. The people
were not going to pay to see it when they could
get something as good or better outside for nothing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“See here, pard, you don’t mean to say you’re
in earnest? I’m business to the hub, you understand;
but I meant just what I told them over
there when I said I wouldn’t make a sale after you
began. How hard are you up against it? I’m
willing to make a fair divvy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He put his hand in his pocket as he spoke, and I
guess he actually meant it.</p>

<p class='c012'>I told him I was all right and that he needed to
feel no concern. I had been opposed to the venture
here from the start, and was not at all averse
to a separation from my companions, as I was
about tired of the show business, anyhow.</p>

<p class='c012'>I answered some questions which he asked; and
then, in turn, grew a little inquisitive. By this
time we had got back in the corner, with no one
to hear us if we talked in a moderate tone, and he
spoke very freely.</p>

<p class='c012'>He admitted that he had made a very fair evening’s
work of it. The pens he sold at twenty-five
cents a dozen cost him thirty-five a gross, and the
boxes and penholders were not sufficiently expensive
to make a very large hole in his profits. He
thought perhaps he would remain in the place at
least for another day. “The pen business,” he
said, “is only a side line, to work in the evenings,
and I haven’t covered the town yet in my canvass.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you don’t confine yourself to the sale of
pens?” I asked. I had supposed the profits of the
evening were sufficient to satisfy almost any man.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not by a jug full,” he answered; “you’ve only
got one life at your finger ends, and if you want
them to stick fast to much of anything you’ve got
to keep moving. And then, you’re liable at any
moment to strike a town that has been worked on
some particular racket, and you’ve got to have another
up your sleeve. I have half a dozen of
them. If a place isn’t ripe for one, another is sure
to win.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good! You are just the man I have been
wanting to see. Don’t you need an apprentice? I
have never done much open-air talking to a crowd,
but I have always had an idea that I would be
great at something of that kind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>My blunt proposition took him somewhat
aback; but he saw that I was in earnest, and
looked me over.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My friend, you appear as though you might
be cut out for a business man. I don’t, as a rule,
need any help, but if you have a little money, and
think I can do you any good, I don’t mind giving
you a start. I can’t do anything with you in this
town, though. You have given them all an idea
of what your line of business is, and for the present
couldn’t change the opinion. You couldn’t
give away a box of pens and throw in a dime.
You’ll have to wait till we get to the next place.
Then you’ll find out pretty quick what you are
good for.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was well enough satisfied with this, as the
night before our haystack had been uncomfortable,
and I had a feeling that I not only wanted a
good night’s rest, but that I had earned it, and the
following day I rested, accordingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know anything about music?” my
companion asked, as we prepared to leave the
place.</p>

<p class='c012'>I answered that I did; that I had some knowledge
of notes, was particularly apt at catching up
a tune by ear, and even had a smattering knowledge
of the piano and violin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good. All that won’t hurt you just now. I
have been working the cheap music racket by daylight,
and it has not turned out so badly. I expect
to do a bigger business in the next place, though,
and I’ll work it in a different way. My pens are
all sold out, and I’ll have no side lines to sell till I
meet my next lot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At that I asked him some questions about the
music business, and he briefly explained.</p>

<p class='c012'>In these degenerate days music, like everything
else, has become cheap. In the times I am speaking
of sheet music commanded a pretty stiff price
at retail; and if we could only sell enough of it
there was a chance for an enormous profit, even
when sold away below regular rates, and there
were chances to buy at wholesale “cheap” sheet
music which cost but a song.</p>

<p class='c012'>All this my companion, whose name was Carter,
explained as we went along. There was really
so little of a “fake” about what he proposed to do
that I hardly believed he would have the success
he seemed to anticipate.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, it all worked to a charm. The
town selected was just large enough to have a
number of amateur pianists and vocalists, and not
sufficiently extensive for a store which kept sheet
music in any great quantity.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a piano in the parlor of the hotel
where we opened up, and almost the first act of
Carter was to thump it vigorously, and after what
looked to be quite an artistic fashion. He had me
plaster the town with bills and posters which we
found there in a bundle awaiting us, announcing
the presence of Prof. Carter and an immense stock
of the most popular and fashionable music, which,
in consequence of business affairs calling him to
the east, he would sell on the easiest terms. Music
for which the stores usually charged from thirty-five
cents to several dollars he would sell at from
fifteen up to seventy-five cents. And he had a list
of the very choicest selections, which would be
sold even lower. The names of the most classical
and popular pieces were given, and it was also announced
that the Professor could be consulted on
musical matters, and the choice of pieces for consecutive
practice, during his short stay.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the first few days the ladies came flocking
in, and usually bought from three to six pieces.
Sometimes we sold as high as ten selections to one
lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>I soon saw that “The Professor” had a fair
knowledge of his business, although, no doubt,
his musical acquirements were somewhat superficial.
The advice he gave gratuitously was sometimes
equal to a high-priced lesson, and I wondered
why he did not make an effort to follow the
profession after a legitimate and exclusive manner.
But he would not have been a fakir had he
done that; and I confess he was one of the best all-round
men I ever saw.</p>

<p class='c012'>While he had a fair stock of the popular, catchy
songs of the day, I noticed the price of it was the
nearest to that marked by the publishers; while his
greatest efforts to sell were made along the lines
of “classical gems,” and easy selections, which he
would rapidly arrange together as a graduated
system of practice. These pieces cost him the least
of any in the lot. He could generally gauge pretty
accurately the musical acquirements of a lady, and
once she entered into conversation with him he
was pretty sure to sell, not only the one piece she
had thought of buying, but half a dozen or more.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was of some slight assistance in the music
deal, but the part I had to play related to something
else, of which, in the start, I knew little or
nothing, but under the rapid instructions of the
Professor I soon comprehended sufficiently to
elicit his strong approval.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had along with the music a nice little line of
fancy feathers, flowers and other little novelties,
which he placed in my charge, and though I had
never handled such things before, it is an actual
fact that the end of the first day found me talking
as glibly about them as any milliner in the land.
When the last customer had departed Carter
turned to me and observed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“No use, Jim, you’ve got it in you, and you’ll
never be anything else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Else than what?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A fakir. Anyone who can talk up female fixtures
and furbelows as you have done, without
knowing any more about them than you do, and
never make a break, is bound to scratch his mark.
From the way you manipulate the dainty things
you might have the touch for a slight-of-hand performer
and magician, but with that smooth tongue
of yours I fancy you have chosen about right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I suppose I blushed at his praise, but tried to
take it as a matter of course, and asked what he
would have done if customers had refused to call.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, called on them, if I thought the town was
worth the working. Otherwise, I would have
shifted my base and tried something else. A man
should always try to have a little money where he
can get hold of it in case of need, and keep a dodge
or two ahead of his customers, so that if one fails
to work he’ll have another to bring on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But no dodge ought to fail,” I put in. “If you
have the thing the people want they are bound to
buy it; and if they don’t want it now, make them
want it by the time you get through. That is my
idea of the business.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And a very good one it is; only, sometimes, receipts
don’t balance expenditures, and then it is
about time to quit and try something else. I can
talk as well as the next, but I have an occasional
failure myself. It looks as though business would
last here for several days yet. By that time we
will be pretty well out of sorts, and I’ve a nice
stock of soap coming for the next stand. If you
want to try your hand I’ll let you do the talking,
and see what you can do with it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The professor was right in his predictions. The
ladies who patronized us the first day sent others
on the second, and returned themselves on the
third. When we left, it was with the good will of
the entire community, and no inconsiderable quantity
of their coin.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Professor Carter changed from music
and millinery to soap he did not think it at all necessary
to change his name at the same time. Indeed,
his name was on the packages, and the article
he put out was a successful curiosity. By the
time we got to work he had drilled me thoroughly
on its history and merits.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was known as Doctor Carter’s Peerless Soap-salve.
It could be used for either a soap or a
salve; the total cost of manufacturing it, without
wrappers, was less than five cents a cake. I know
that it sold freely at twenty-five.</p>

<p class='c012'>We had a little preliminary practice before
reaching the town which was to be the scene of
operations, and I appeared before the crowd confident
in my ability, and anxious to test the glibness
of my tongue. The doctor had given me the
patter he usually employed, and of course I expected
to use it as an outline, subject to alteration
as occasion permitted or required. He carried a
violin, and it did not take long to draw a crowd.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was, of course, no haste in getting to the
sales. I began by telling what the soap-salve was
good for. I gave them a little historical lecture on
all soap in general, and this soap in particular.
Finally, to illustrate how far a small portion
would go, I took a large sponge, which had been
passed around for examination. As the doctor
handed it to me he concealed in it a cake of soap.
From another cake I had made a few shavings,
and having poured a little water over the sponge
the amount of lather I made appear from those
shavings was a caution; and the crowd was about
in shape to appreciate the story I then told, which
was about as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“More than that, gentlemen and ladies—for I
see there are a few of the latter in the audience,
and I wish there were more—I want to tell you
how the lives of four hundred people were, on a
memorable occasion, saved by this very identical
soap.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was on a large steamship, on my way to England.
Upon a beautiful morning, when the sun
had been shining brightly in the heavens, and
dancing in great waves over the white-crested billows,
peace and harmony and happiness prevailing
among the passengers, a sudden and severe wind
storm came up. Black clouds overcast the sky, and
the wind blew so strong that the huge vessel was
tossed about as though a mere toy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Every one on board became excited. Women
screamed and fainted. Down in the cabin a group
was gathered to pray for safe deliverance from the
wrath of the hurricane. We were doomed. In a
few moments the vessel ran upon hidden rocks,
the boilers exploded, and our ship was on fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There we were, on a burning vessel, stranded
upon the rocks, and far, far from shore. Death
and a watery grave stared us in the face. Can you
imagine our despair?</p>

<p class='c012'>“No time was to be lost. We must act, and act
quickly. The life boats were lowered; but they
could not hold all the passengers, so that we had
to shift as best we could. I helped the women, and
some of the men, into the boats, and then found, to
my horror, there was no room for me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I picked up my valise, which was filled with
this soap, grabbed the gang-plank of the vessel,
and jumped into the ocean.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My valise had no sooner struck the water than
the soap began to foam. The bubbles grew, and
kept increasing in size until they resembled a
mountain of snow. Would you believe it? Every
one of those four hundred heart-broken passengers
jumped on that huge lump of lather and
floated safely to shore.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, my friends, was not that wonderful? So
happy were they all when they landed that they
chipped in a dollar each, every man ordering a
cake sent to his address as soon as I could receive
a fresh supply to replace that lost in their salvation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But tonight, my friends, I am not going to
charge you a dollar a cake. You have not yet been
ship-wrecked, though it is as well for you to prepare.
Twenty-five cents is all that I shall ask you,
and then you will be ready for the direst extremity
and the darkest emergency.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, then, who takes the first cake?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You do,” shouted a voice from the crowd, and
the laugh was on me.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, I accepted the turn so readily, and
put it aside so neatly, that it was all the better,
since I had the crowd with me. Before the evening
was over the stock was sold out slick and
clean.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Contemptible Piano Tuner—The
Biographical Write-up Fake—The Flattered
Blacksmith.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>“There are tricks in all trades but ours,” quoted
the doctor that night, when he had returned to the
hotel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I suppose the reason there are no tricks
in our trade is because there is positively no epidermis
to hold them. It is trickery and nothing
else.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nevertheless, there are tricks; and there are
other tricks. I have no patience with the others.
My principle, as I have already explained, is to
always give a man the worth of his money at ordinary,
every-day market prices. If an emergency
arises when I can’t do that I try and see that he
receives no damage. The fakir that sells a tooth-wash
which will eat the enamel off the first application,
and crumble the teeth to the gums by the
third, deserves to be hung.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a little strange,” he added, reflectively,
“how some of the gang can talk the senses out of
the average individual, and make him see that
black is white. I don’t approve of such methods,
and it rather gratifies me when I see a fakir of that
class come to grief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I remember once, when I was selling bibles up
in Minnesota, I had the extreme pleasure of seeing
one of the meanest, most contemptible little scoundrels
of the species arrested and brought to justice.
On the chance of making a trifling ten dollars
for himself he had done more than that much
damage, which he did not know how to properly
repair, and possibly ruined a six hundred dollar
instrument. And he seemed to have been working
the scheme right along until he was accidentally
caught up by a young lady—upon whom I
happened to call, in the midst of the wreck, for
the purpose of introducing my fine line of cottage
bibles.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You understand, I love a fine piano, and have
a sneaking regard for an instrument of almost
any kind. But this was, or had been, a good one,
and the way the fellow temporarily ruined it was
this:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The house stood by itself, with vacant lots on
either side. He walked up to the front and
knocked. When the young lady came to the door
he looked up inquiringly, and then slowly and in
a disappointed manner, as though speaking to
himself, remarked:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘I can’t understand it.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Understand what?’ asked the young lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Before answering he consulted a card in his
hand, which had some penciling on the back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why, I am the traveling tuner of the Mittlebache
Piano Company. Yesterday somebody sent
an order to me at the hotel to call at number 413,
this street. There is no such number, I see; but as
this is 415 I thought I would drop in and see if
you were not the lady.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘No, sir; I am not,’ was the answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘By the way, what is the name of your piano?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Oh, mine is rather an old one. It is called
the Wilson,’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You don’t say so. I hardly expected to find
one of them in this part of the country; but it is
the coming instrument. We carry a line of them
at our headquarters. Wilson seems to be the one
man who has mastered the art of making a piano
which improves by age. The instrument ought
to be like a violin in that respect, but you know, of
course, that the output of the average piano manufacturer
is not.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“While carrying on this conversation he walked
into the house, the lady remarking:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I supposed the make was out of the market.
I never hear of it now at all, and this is the only
one I ever saw,’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Not at all, not at all; Wilson is conservative,
and don’t want to put out any more pianos than he
can build on honor. I understand he always has
orders ahead for a year. I should have thought
you would have noticed in the papers the account
of the magnificent ones he has lately put in the
White House. He don’t advertise; he don’t have
to. No piano manufacturer does until his sales
fall off. Ah, yes. One of the early make; but it
ought to be a good one, nevertheless.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“By this time he was on the stool, fingers spread
out, and he ran over the scales for a moment, at a
great rate, a frown gradually darkening his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Who in the world tuned this piano?’ he
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The lady mentioned the name of the tuner, and
added that it was some months since he had done
the work.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should think so. It’s not in tune even a
little bit, and sounds as though there was something
wrong inside. Don’t you want me to fix it
for you? I’ll do the tuning for one dollar, and
straighten up everything else for a trifle. I’ve a
little time to spare before dinner, as it don’t seem
likely that I can find that lady. Only one dollar
for the tuning.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“The colossal cheek of the man, and the low
price he named for the work, naturally had their
effect, and she looked at him hesitatingly. He
turned up his cuffs and asked for a piece of flannel
with which to dust off the piano, remarking in a
jocular way that he would not charge for doing
that.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Unsuspectingly, the young lady hustled off for
the flannel, and while she was out of the room he
quickly opened the instrument and slipped in a
small, artificial mouse’s nest, at the same time
snipping a few wires, perhaps doing more damage
than he intended. When she returned he was already
to show her in what a horrible condition
the mice had got her instrument.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At such a point in the game he usually talked
so glibly and smoothly and worked the nerves of
his poor victim up to such a tension that she
gladly employed him to renovate the affair, and
paid him ten dollars, without question, for the
work of an hour or so.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In this case he failed; first, because the young
lady had not been entirely hypnotized; and second,
because there was neither mouse, rat, nor roach in
their house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This fact she knew, and that in the interim
her instrument had been tuned. She looked the
villain in the face and charged him with the full
enormity of his rascally act; whereat, he turned
and fled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I happened on the scene a few minutes later,
and it may be it was my counsel which brought
the offender to justice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Such was the story of the doctor, and he told it
with a vim and gusto that made me believe he
was in earnest in his denunciation of such a questionable
style of faking. I then and there vowed
to myself to avoid that class of work; and ever
after kept the vow—except in cases of unavoidable
necessity.</p>

<p class='c012'>The question which presented itself to my
mind was, what were we to do next. In spite of
what Carter had said about always keeping a
stock ahead, it seemed to me he had about reached
the end of his resources—in other words, he had
sold out all his stock in trade. The pens were exhausted,
so was the sheet music, so was the soap.
I asked him what he intended to do next.</p>

<p class='c012'>Well, you see, my son, I have been out some
time, and had thought of winding up the present
campaign and taking a run to New York to look
up novelties. I have done first rate this fall, and
have a pretty good wad to buy with for the winter’s
work.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you can’t keep on through the winter, can
you?” I asked, thinking the question would be
apt to draw him out and increase my store of
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The work goes on, but it is of a different kind.
But, as I was going to say, I will stay out a little
longer, for the sake of your education; and you
will learn that a person in our line of business is
not dependent on capital, whether in the shape of
money or goods. His brains must be his mainstay
and dependence, and the more he knows in the
way of general education the better it will be for
him. You have a great deal to learn, and if you
want to be a success in the field to which you seem
to have been called you won’t have an idle moment
you can call your own. For the remainder of the
week I shall proceed to boom and advertise a
town. There is good money in it, although it is
not every one who is fitted to work the racket. It
takes a man of not only good knowledge of human
nature, but of wide experience and considerable
journalistic ability.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Accordingly, the next day we set off for the
town he had selected, and which he assured me
had not been worked after the fashion he proposed.</p>

<p class='c012'>B——. was a thriving little city of three or four
thousand inhabitants, which had several newspapers
that were fairly well supported. The history
of this place Dr. Carter already had at his
finger ends, and the names of the prominent citizens
were more than familiar. He had already
looked the ground over, or had it looked over, I
was not certain which. This saved him some little
time, though I believe he could have gone in, a
perfect stranger to every soul, and still met with
as thorough a success. I have done it myself more
than once when no more promising field of operations
appeared to be open.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our first business call was upon the editor
whom Carter had chosen as his local helper.</p>

<p class='c012'>He introduced himself as Dr. Carter, of the
Eastern Globe, out to write up the country and its
resources for his paper, but meantime with an eye
open for the profit of himself and friend. To describe
his scheme briefly, he proposed to the editor,
who was also proprietor, to get out a special number
of the Daily Hornet, in which should be given
a write-up of the city and its business men, the
doctor to do the soliciting and literary work, and
receive his end of the profits.</p>

<p class='c012'>Country editors are always susceptible to the
word profits, since, with few exceptions, I have
found them seriously affected with shortness of
cash, and ready to turn an honest dollar at any
hour of the day or night.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Mathews, of the Hornet, was no exception.
After the doctor (or professor, whichever you
choose to call him) had held him under fire of his
verbal battery a short time he made unconditional
capitulation, and started out with us to make introductions,
gather materials, and prepare the way
for contracts.</p>

<p class='c012'>A few moments’ observation convinced me that
the editor was as great a fakir as ourselves, even
though he did not wear the badge on his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c012'>He introduced Mr. Carter, of the East, as of
the editorial staff, detailed to make observations
through the state with a view to a writing up of
its most promising and prominent business men
and institutions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have induced him to stop at B——. long
enough to give me the assistance of his valuable
pen in writing up our city and its noted people, a
plan which I have long had in contemplation. I
shall get out a special edition of twenty thousand
of the number containing the article, and while
copies will go all over the state, I shall see that
every family in the county is supplied. They will
be kept for reference, and I need hardly tell you
will be of incalculable value to all parties concerned.
We are around interviewing a few of the
leading citizens on the subject, and I do not expect
to find any difference of opinion as to the importance
of the matter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The very nature of such an approach was
enough to give the prospective customer the
swelled head. It pleased him that he was recognized
as a solid pillar of the town, and he usually
took the bait with a smile, and said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly, gentlemen, what can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that question the editor retired from action,
and Carter stepped to the front. He explained
that a country was known better by its
people than by its natural advantages, and that
one live—really and truly live—business man was
worth more to a town than a million dollars in
capital. There could not be many in B——., but
there were some who were influential and prominent,
and he proposed to place their biographies
where they would be of public record. Of course,
their present host was of the number who would
receive early attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mixed in with this, and following it, and all
around it, was a running fire of questions as to
when the gentleman was born, where raised, what
great deeds he had performed, how he served in
the war, getting in a brief way his whole life and
career from the time he was born until the present
day, as well as the particulars of the business in
which he was engaged. All this, of course, without
asking for financial support.</p>

<p class='c012'>Other calls were made of a similar nature—a
good many of them, in fact. And then Professor
Carter went to his room at the hotel armed with a
battery of pens, ink and paper and began to write.
He wrote rapidly and in extravagant praise of the
business men of B——. The first sketch read
something like this:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. John Smith, the subject of this sketch,
was born in Jim Crow township, Boozer county,
Indiana, just fifty-six years ago. When only a
boy his father died, forcing him to enter active
life at a very tender age. His lot was cast with a
blacksmith, and he began with indomitable energy
to work his way up. Today Mr. Smith is not only
one of our leading business men, but has one of
the best equipped blacksmith shops in the state,
and enjoys the reputation of being the best horse-shoer
in the valley of the Mississippi. At the
breaking out of the civil war Mr. Smith enlisted
in the —— Indiana Regiment of Volunteers,
taking part with the regiment in seventeen different
battles. For an act of bravery, in which he
carried the flag under a heavy charge, President
Lincoln wrote him a personal letter, commending
him for the deed. Mr. Smith is one of the pioneers
of this city, having lived here ever since the
close of the war, so that his name is a household
word in B——. Although Mr. Smith is 56 years
old, married happily, and has a large family,
prominent in social circles, he is still a young looking
man, of most prepossessing appearance, public
spirited, a leader of men, and universally recognized
as the most prominent and logical candidate
for mayor at the ensuing election.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When these articles were written the really serious
business of the campaign was at hand. For
instance, Carter took this copy to Smith, showed
it to him, and read it over for personal correction
and approval.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, Smith was pleased.</p>

<p class='c012'>Doctor Carter tells him he intends to put his engraved
picture above the article, and that it is expected
the citizens will help out liberally on
the enterprise, which not only does justice to
them, but will attract attention to the town.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Smith probably subscribed for fifty copies—twelve
dollars and a half—and put up five dollars
more, and a photograph, in order that his
likeness might grace the pages of the Hornet supplement.
If he had been the proprietor of a large
mercantile establishment the tariff would most
likely have been as much more. Every relative of
Mr. John Smith, to the third and fourth generation
doubtless received a marked copy of that
paper.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, an edition which exceeded the normal
output by at least twenty fold was valuable
for legitimate advertising, and its space per inch
worth a sum which, compared with ordinary numbers,
was almost fabulous. Of that fact, Mr.
Matthews no doubt made his account, but with it
we had nothing to do. When the last bill for
write-ups and “cuts” (on these a profit of two to
five hundred per cent. was made) had been collected
to the uttermost farthing, the doctor professed
himself as satisfied, and prepared to move
out in search of “fresh fields and pastures green.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And now the hour of our parting was at hand,
and I was to find myself once more adrift, though
this time more ready and capable to take up the
battle and fight for a fortune.</p>

Business—Talk and Auction Gags—The
Boy Auctioneer—Parting With Prof.
Carter.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>Before we separated the doctor gave me some
parting words of admonition.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My son,” he said, beaming on me in a proud
and happy way—for were not his pockets filled to
bursting with the result of the raid on B——.?
“it is dead easy to work the public if you have
confidence in yourself, and a thorough understanding
of the people with whom you deal.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have been in the business a good many years,
and I know whereof I speak. You will have your
downs as well as ups, since you are a young man,
and cannot always gauge the amount of strength
needed, or know the exact nature of the forces
which must be brought to bear. You will probably
be beaten sometimes, and busted often; but under
every circumstance, never despair. You were put
here to make a living, and if you don’t succeed it
is your own fault. I have given you an insight
into different branches of fakirdom; cultivate the
rest after the same fashion. They are all alike,
and founded on the same general principles.
These monitions heed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never carry an old sample case. It looks bad
and hurts your business.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Put your whole heart and soul into business,
and ‘stick to your knitting.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“A good argument for one thing answers as
well for another. Don’t forget it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get to the level of your customer, but remain
a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Flatter the young woman of the house. If you
have her, you’ve got the mother; and nine times
out of ten the gray mare is the better horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is much easier to bamboozle a woman than
a man, but the profits are apt to be less. Too
much time is wasted, and time is money.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t make a second call, unless you have time
to burn. Stay with a man as long as there is hope,
and then leave him for some one else to warm
over. If he wants you he’ll send for you; if he
don’t, he’s thought of a dozen arguments against
you he didn’t advance before.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One gift to the wife or daughter of a landlord
is worth more to secure attention than tips to a
dozen waiters.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is nothing will do you more good than
church going. If it don’t happen to save your soul
it will surely help your pockets.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hold your own. If you take a little of some
people’s mouths they will think you a fool, and
give you a great deal more.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A trunk and a bank account are both evidences
of responsibility, even if the one is empty and the
other is small. If you can’t conquer both, carry a
trunk, anyhow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A few good names at the top of a list brings
Tom, Dick and Harry at the tail; but if you begin
with Tom, Dick and Harry, the list will be all tail,
and a short one at that.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s a fortune in a new fake, but it won’t
work in the same community twice; and two of a
kind coming close together make a bad pair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If, when you are hard up, you think of a
scheme which seems likely, try it. You have nothing
to lose and everything to win. If you waste
time trying to decide, or to think of something
better, the golden moment may slip by.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Such maxims he poured forth for my future
guidance. He then told me he was going to Chicago
to prepare for the further work, asked me to
keep him advised where a letter would reach me,
and promising to post me in regard to any novelties
in the market. After some other talk about
our hopes and intentions he left me. It was long
before I saw him again.</p>

<p class='c012'>I confess I felt a trifle lonely, and at a loss what
to do with myself. I had plenty of money for
present needs, and a little capital with which I
could purchase a small stock of something to sell;
but I did not at the moment know what I wanted
or which way to turn, and the doctor had offered
no suggestions. It was an understood matter
that I was to at least try to hoe my own row.</p>

<p class='c012'>I lounged down to the station, and while staring
aimlessly after a departing train was surprised
to hear my own name called and have some one
slap me on the back.</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked around quickly, and lo, it was my old
friend, the lightning rod man.</p>

<p class='c012'>We shook hands heartily, while I expressed my
surprise at seeing him, and curiosity to know how
he came to be here, when I supposed he was at
Davenport, and hardly able to hobble out of the
hospital.</p>

<p class='c012'>He explained it in short order. The broken
bones had knit very nicely and rapidly. He was
now on his way to a neighboring city to look after
a small stock of goods for which, some six months
before, he had traded a patent right. The goods
were not worth much, but neither was the patent,
and he thought that by taking them out of storage
he could realize expenses and enough to keep him
afloat until he was entirely ready once more for
business.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What sort of goods are they?” I asked, at once
alive to the possibility which might lurk behind
the name.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Notions and ready-made clothing,” he answered.
“I believe there is some good stuff in it,
too; but the whole lot is out of date, and part of it
damaged.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right; I’ll go along with you and help you.
Just now I’ve nothing to do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what have you been doing, and how are
you off for coin? You have hardly made a fortune
in soap-foam signs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I explained briefly then, and afterwards at
greater length.</p>

<p class='c012'>We took the train together that evening, and I
told him my little experiences since we parted.
The next day we hunted up the stock, which he
told me had been valued as low as nine hundred
dollars, but which, when opened out, made quite
a respectable showing. We also rented a large,
vacant store-room. I told him the people didn’t
know me, and consequently would not know the
goods, and I was confident there could be good
money made selling them off at auction. As he
had very little money, I advanced what was necessary,
and proposed to act as auctioneer myself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right,” he answered, “let it go at that. If
we make even a couple of hundred dollars out of it
I will be satisfied—so it is cash.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If we can sell anything at all we surely can get
that,” I assured him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Carlysle was a trifle dubious about my
abilities, but my late little experiences had helped
me wonderfully, and given me thorough confidence.
I thought, moreover, of a dodge which, no
matter what the line, has always worked. I assumed
as youthful an appearance as possible and
he had me advertised all over town as “The boy
auctioneer.” That brought the people out in
swarms, and when I saw the crowd we had succeeded
in gathering I knew we had ‘em. Carlysle
had given me a thorough coaching in private, and
I felt that there was no danger of being at a loss
for something to say. When I began I confess I
was a trifle nervous from stage fright, but after
selling a few minor articles I was all right and
ready to start in full swing. If there is anything
the boy from a farm has heard it is the patter of
an auctioneer. I had listened to it a hundred
times, and I went on something like this:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gentlemen, you all know I am no resident merchant,
and before I get fairly into this sale I wish
to make an explanation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I traded for this stock of goods, and under the
circumstances it is a white elephant on my hands.
The quicker I get rid of it the better off I will be.
When I say I am going to close out this stock regardless
of cost or value I mean it, I positively
mean it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The first thing I shall put up will be a fine, custom-made
suit of clothing. Mr. Carlysle, will you
please hand me up the very best suit you can find
in the lot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Carlysle, after looking around a moment,
passed up the suit already agreed on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, gentlemen, here is a nice, black, custom-made
suit of clothes that cost twenty-six dollars,
direct from the manufacturer. If you will look
carefully at the price marked on the collar you will
see it was intended to sell at thirty-five. How
much am I offered as a starter? How much, gentlemen?
Make a bid. I don’t care how much or
how little. Your price is my price, and whatever
you say goes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you give twenty dollars?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No; will you give ten dollars? Five dollars?
No? Two dollars? Not even two dollars? Well,
then, who’ll offer me one dollar?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, thank you, sir. Now, there is a man with
a level head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t like to start a thirty-five dollar suit of
clothes for one dollar, but I’ll do it, just the same,
and here goes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One dollar I’m offered, one dollar, one dollar;
who’ll make it two?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, sir. Two dollars, two dollars,
two dollars I have; who’ll make it three?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Three dollars I have; who is generous enough
to bring it up to four?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes; there is a smart man over yonder, who
knows a good thing when he sees it. Four dollars
I have, at four, at four, at four; who’ll make it
five? who’ll make it five?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Remember, gentlemen, this is a genuine, all wool,
imported English worsted, that cost twenty-six
dollars, and was price-marked thirty-five. We
guarantee a fit if you are near the size, or refund
the money. Do I hear the five? Will you give the
five. Who’ll say the five? Will you make the
five, at four, at four, at four and going, going—going
at four. At four, at four, at four—did I
hear the five? Holy smoke. What’s the matter
with this town? Do you want a man to stand up
here and yell his lungs out for a dollar? Why,
I’m twenty-two dollars in the hole, now, as it
stands. Do you expect me to get up here and sell
you twenty dollar gold pieces for the small sum of
ten cents?</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a crying shame for you to stand here and
let a thirty-five dollar suit of clothes go for four
dollars. Why, it’s worth more than that for an
every-day, knock-around business outfit, to say
nothing of the fact that it’s all right for dress
occasions. What, four fifty do I hear? No, sir;
I don’t take a half dollar bid at this stage of the
proceedings. If you’ll raise it fifty cents I’ll cry
your bid. All right. Thank you, sir. Five I
have; now, who’ll give me six?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look here gentlemen, I am willing to sacrifice
the stock, but I hate to be compelled to actually
give it away. Why, it would be a shame to the
town to sell a suit like that for five dollars. Some
of you fellows down there, with ruffles on your
pants, can’t you make it six? And if you’re not
satisfied after wearing it five years come back and
I’ll make you a present of one hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t dwell all day on a single article; so, be
lively with your bids, or I’ll knock it down before
you can wink. At five, at five, at five, at five, at
five, at five—will you give me the six?</p>

<p class='c012'>“No? Five once, five twice, five third and last
go—did I hear the six?</p>

<p class='c012'>“At last. Just in time; so, six I have; at six, at
six, at six. Come along with your little bids now.
I hear six and a half. Who’ll make it seven? I
tell you, gentlemen, in after years this sacrifice
may cause me to shed many a bitter tear, but like
the great majority it has got to go, unless some
fair-minded person makes it seven. Six fifty?
Six fifty? Will no one raise it fifty? Six dollars
fifty, once. Six dollars fifty, twice. Six fifty,
third and last call, and sold—to that gentleman
there under the gas light, and a mighty good bargain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was a good sale all around, and after this
suit was sold I felt more than ever confident, and
was ready for whatever came next. I went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, then, gentlemen, don’t be impatient.
There is plenty more clothing, but I really must
protect my own interests a little bit. When I said
I was going to sell this stock regardless of cost or
value I didn’t mean I would give away the picked
lots and throw in a chromo to have you take them.
I know, when you get your eyes open, you’ll meet
me half way; and here is an eye-opener, and the
expense will neither make nor break you.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here is a job lot of combs, coarse combs, fine
combs, horse combs, honey combs and the comb of
a roof; we’ll take this fine tooth comb first.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here it is, gentlemen, already for business,
white as the driven snow, and with two rows of
teeth as sharp as the edge of a fine razor. I will
guarantee it to catch ‘em every time, dead or alive.
It’s a sure winner, a double-geared, switch-back
combination, that will work either forward or
backward, without a single kick. It is hand-turned,
double-soled, and made from genuine
ivory, worth four hundred dollars a pound, and
a good day for elephants at that. How much do I
hear to start it? Will you give me a quarter?
No? Will you give me a dime? No? Do I hear
any one whisper the ridiculous small sum of a
nickel? What! Don’t shake your heads sideways;
always shake them up and down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurry up your bids, gentlemen. Tempus
Fugit, as the astronomer says. Time flies. Yes,
time flies; and so do the little vermin this comb is
warranted to lay low. Will no one give me a bid?
I never saw a lousy man buy a comb in my life.
You needn’t be ashamed. You won’t find a sale
on record, from the time Noah made a clearing
sale on closing business at the ark, where the purchaser
needed the article for his own use. Slip it
in the package the next time you want to send
some books to a starving cripple who has just lost
his spectacles, and when you are nosing around
for something to put in the contribution box for
the poor, benighted heathen, think how handy it
would be to have it in the house. Does nobody
say five cents? Third and last call at—thank you.
You’ll take it. Sold at five cents. You’re a clear-headed
man for sure, and I hope there is more in
the crowd.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a laugh at this, and I began to feel
more confident than ever. I kept on at the combs
until I had sold the entire assortment. By and by
I opened a watch.</p>

<p class='c012'>The crowd was willing, but slow to start. Each
man wanted to take time to consider the outside
figure he was willing to pay for the article, provided
he had the least thought of purchasing. I
was satisfied to let the customer have plenty of
time, because he might make a bid, even if it was
within the figure he placed as the top notch. If he
once began bidding, such a limit would cut no ice
at all. After some preliminary remarks I shouted
at the top of my voice:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Under or over the top of God’s green earth I
never saw the like before. You stand perpetually
blind to your own interests, and wait for the other
fellow to get the bargain. When I offer you a
fifty dollar watch I can’t even get a four dollar bid
on it, and still you wonder why you are poor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, gentlemen, remember that this is a fact,
a tried, tested and practical fact. Everywhere in
this generation, the human mind is busier than
ever in extending its prerogatives. If you don’t
believe me turn to the ninth chapter of Isaiah and
read the twenty-fourth verse where it says, ‘It is
easier for an elephant to walk through the eye of
a needle than a poor man to enter into the kingdom
of heaven,’</p>

<p class='c012'>“The physical necessity of mental activity in
every practical sense confers upon the mind the
power of determining the actual strength of longevity.
So, prepare yourselves, gentlemen, for
one of the most startling revelations yet to come.
We are living in times when people know what
goods are. To keep abreast with them we must
organize and increase our capacity to thirty million
times its natural strength and power.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To illustrate, look back along the ages and see
that poor man there, bending over the stone mortar,
pulverizing the fluidy grains into a more
minute form. Watch him. See. He stops and
gazes at yonder precipitous torrent thundering
down a rocky channel in its course. There, a
thought has struck him. He begins to whistle,
and then to whittle, for he learned to whistle soon
after he learned to breathe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“His hands are clumsy, but brains furnish skill,
and practice makes perfect. He gears together a
dozen wooden wheels, some horizontal, some perpendicular,
and makes a mortar, such as he had
never seen before that moment of inspiration. He
turns on the water. The wheel revolves. The
mortar grinds, and out rolls the meal in a golden
stream, while he claps his hands in triumph, and
thinks what the machine would do if it were a
thousand times stronger.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Therefore, remember, gentlemen, I am not
conscientiously, virtuously, righteously nor religiously,
but just good naturedly, giving these
goods away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here is this watch, now; a fine Elgin, with a
twenty-year case set in two plates of gold, adjusted
to both heat and cold, with economical hair
spring, regulated by sun, moon and stars, and it
will even tell you the price of cheese in Canada.
I’m not going to force you to take it at this moment,
and as no one seems ready to make a decent
bid I’ll lay it by until the gang gets in from the
railroad, and switch off on to this elegant suit of
underwear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How much am I offered to start it, the choice
with the privilege? Remember, these garments
are all wool, through and through, double-hitched
and double-stitched, ribbed up and down, as perfectly
seamless as the leg of a woman’s stocking,
and guaranteed to live three years without washing.
The winter days are fast coming on, when
underwear will be more precious than diamonds,
and the tariff will send prices up a-booming. Take
a pair of these drawers homeland after wearing
them all winter you can sneak around to some
dressmaker in the spring, and she can fix them so
the old woman can wear them next summer.
Now, don’t all bid at once. Yes, yes, I’m listening.
That’s right. Keep it up. You can’t all have
this one pair, and they go to that man over there,
cheap as dirt and good as gold. Here’s another
suit. Shall we start them where the other left off—and
who speaks first?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The second set went higher than the first, and
there was no trouble to close out the entire line,
for the articles were good lookers and, as I had
told them, the season was coming when they
would be needed. The watch went later on at a
very good price, and, in fact, the entire stock of
stuff rattled off like hot cakes, whilst I succeeded
in keeping the crowd in good buying humor to the
very last. It took several weeks to finish up the
job, but when the hammer came down for the last
time I had cleaned out everything, even to the
empty boxes, and Carlysle had in his pocket several
hundred dollars. I received a hundred for my
labors, and might have had more, but I did not
care to rob a man who had been my friend and
had risked my gaining experience and confidence
at his expense. We got out of the place together,
but I dropped off the train at the next considerable
city and, like Alexander, looked around for more
worlds to conquer.</p>

Fair—Street Work—The Catchy Little
Lookbacks—Giving Them Away—The Horse
and Loaf of Bread Trick—Handling Microscopes.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>I now had capital enough to purchase a stock
of goods and to embark in the business of traveling
salesman and fakir after the most approved
fashion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Unfortunately, perhaps, I had no such stock to
my hand, and as yet not sufficiently versed in the
ways of the trade to know exactly what I wanted,
or where to get it. At present I was inclined to
wait until I could hear from Dr. Carter before
making any investment. I was willing to trust to
his judgment, rather than to anyone else, as to
what would be a swift selling novelty, and how to
handle it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Later on I was seldom thus at fault.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are thousands of firms throughout the
country which transact their business exclusively
through agents. Many of them make a specialty
of fakirs’ goods, and are always on the lookout for
something new. They get all the novelties, as
fast as they come out, and bring them before the
public by advertising.</p>

<p class='c012'>I afterwards watched the want columns of all
the newspapers, and wrote to different firms for
their catalogues. I did not patronize every firm,
but by thus getting in touch with them I was able
to keep posted on everything new in the market,
and thereby make a selection of the best.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of this course I had some idea, having been
posted by the professor; but as yet had not had
time to put it in practice. However, I did not intend
to remain idle in the interim. Time was money,
and I could not afford to squander either. I
looked over the city in a hurry, and began to feel
almost ashamed. Here was a whole day almost
gone, and I had done nothing. I might hear from
the doctor as early as the following day, but that
was not tonight. What was I to do with myself?
Perhaps the hours were not so nearly lost as I imagined,
but I certainly felt uneasy. Not being able
to find work, work found me.</p>

<p class='c012'>It so happened that the good women of the Baptist
church had a fair going on in the town hall,
the proceeds to go for new furniture
for the parsonage, their young minister
having been lately married. This was
the last night, and they had a number of
articles on hand which it was proposed to auction
off. Among them was a large cake, beautifully
frosted and decorated, which they had believed
would bring them good money.</p>

<p class='c012'>Unfortunately, at the last moment, word came
that the auctioneer could not be present.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here was a pretty kettle of fish. It is not every
one who can play the auctioneer, and the crowd
had been counting on having as much amusement
as profit out of this closing sale.</p>

<p class='c012'>I heard the members anxiously whispering
among themselves, with many ahs and plenty of
ohs, and to listen to them one would suppose that
the whole church outfit was on the verge of ruin.
Though my native modesty would have kept me
out of the ring, I could not stand the sight of their
tribulation, and came to the front with a smile,
offering my services in as bland and genteel a
manner as I was capable of assuming.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was a stranger to them all, except so far as I
had made a few friends that evening through
some liberal patronage at a few of the various
stands, but after looking me over they must have
decided there was something in my appearance
quite in my favor. They promptly accepted my
services, and I took a place on the stand without
hesitation. A man who had lately cleaned out
such an old stock of goods as I had done would
hardly have much fear of tackling a prize cake at
a church festival.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pushing up my cuffs I began:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ladies and gentlemen: It is hardly necessary
to remark that I am a stranger within your gates,
and a very strange stranger at that. I want to
tell you that you have a very fine little city—the
greatest one, in fact, I ever saw—especially for a
man who is about down to bed-rock. When I landed
here this morning I was expecting remittances. I
had just ten cents in my pocket, and was hungry
as a bear. Yes, sirs and madames, I was just
awfully hungry. I do believe if I had found a
map of the world at that moment I could have
eaten the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But listen. I went into a restaurant and, walking
up to the waiter, said, ‘See here, my man, what
do you charge for chickens?’ ‘Two dollars
apiece,’ he replied. ‘What do you charge for eggs
and bread and butter?’ I asked. ‘Four eggs for a
dime and the rest thrown in,’ was his answer.
‘Give me the four eggs,’ said I; and would you
believe it, the first egg I opened I found a chicken.
There I was, one dollar and ninety cents ahead on
the first clatter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I went around to a hotel to put up for
the day, and I hadn’t more than registered when
the strangest thing happened you ever heard of.
All the victuals in the kitchen got into an argument.
There was a piece of chicken on the shelf
and it saw the Worcestershire sauce at the other
end. Turning to the salt it said, ‘Will you please
pass me that bottle of liniment, I’ve got the rheumatism;’
and that started the biggest kind of a
fight. It was a regular rough and tumble affair,
in which everybody took a hand except the syrup—that
was too stuck up. The coffee was weak,
and made a poor showing, but the sugar was
rather sweet on it and turned in to help it out.
The vinegar looked on with a sour, sarcastic air
without interfering, and the pepper was so bitter
at the whole crowd it just urged them all to fight
the harder. The butter thought it was pretty
strong and pitched in for a little fun, but they
soon melted it. The cook stove, which was nursing
a fire, watched the fight from its door, and was
beginning to get pretty warm. The longer it
looked at them the hotter it grew, until it couldn’t
stand it any more and began to yell for the police.
Oh, it was terrible. The cabbage came out with a
swelled head, the potatoes were all mashed to
pieces, the chicken got an awful roast, and there is
no telling where the thing would have ended if a
big Irish policeman had not just then appeared on
the scene. I slipped out while he was attending to
the fighters, and, going to the postoffice, found,
thank heaven, that my remittances had arrived
and for that reason I was able to do my whole
duty tonight in patronizing this estimable institution.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, ladies and gentlemen, I appear before
you in the capacity of auctioneer for this magnificent,
double-decked, thoroughbred, high-stepping,
copper-bottomed, fast-sailing, number one church
cake, warranted not to pinch in the armholes, pull
apart in the seams, or show the stains of grease,
gravy, petroleum or lard oil. One bite of this
cake is a revelation, and two insures a dream.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After going on this way I asked for bids, but
no one would say a word or start the cake. They
seemed to be backward about speaking. At last
I said: “You all know, in selling goods at auction,
that it is customary to take winks for a bid, but
perhaps that won’t do in this case. No, a wink
won’t do, but I’ll tell you what will, and that is, a
smile. If you don’t care to wink, or talk, just
look at me and smile and I’ll catch the meaning all
the same.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally, this puckered the majority of
mouths for a smile at the very outset, and beginning
that cake at one dollar, two dollars, three dollars,
four dollars, etc., I ran it rapidly up to sixty
dollars. I kept up a running fire of jokes, and
every time I caught a smile on a pair of lips I
would yell an extra dollar bid. Then I said:
‘Sixty dollars, last call. Once, twice, three times,
sold to —’ I got that far, but in the rush which
followed my voice could not possibly have been
heard. The way those women scattered was a
sight to see.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were frightened, because every one had
smiled at some part or other of the harangue, and
there was great fear I had accepted that smile for
a bid and would compel some one of them to take
that cake. So they fled, pell-mell, to the different
corners of the hall, and I was much afraid they
would never stop until they had reached home.</p>

<p class='c012'>When, however, peace was restored, I explained
that it was all a joke, and they came back with
such looks of relief on their faces that I had to
laugh myself. The cake was offered a second
time, and finally knocked down to a bona fide purchaser
at ten dollars and twenty cents. Amid
much cheering I retired from the stand, the hero
of the hour.</p>

<p class='c012'>If there was no immediate profit in this, there
was pleasure and practice, and I went to my hotel
tolerably well satisfied with the way I had spent
the evening. The next day, as I had hoped, I
heard from the doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'>He told me in his letter that he had forwarded
me a supply of the Goldentine Pens, and several
other articles which he thought I could manage.
He also gave an outline of the way he thought
they could best be handled; and after looking the
articles over I determined to follow his suggestions,
adding some amendments of my own. As
the business at the church fair had given me some
little reputation, I thought I could not do better
than begin operations that very evening.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since then, when engaged in street faking, I
have generally had with me a musical assistant or
two. Nothing will draw a crowd quicker than a
few vigorous plunks on a banjo, or the squeak of
a fiddle played “well up in G.” Not having such
an assistant, I was fortunate enough to be able to
secure some local talent.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a little music I stood up, made my bow,
and gave about the following harangue:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gentlemen, with your kind permission, I will
entertain you for a few moments with a few tricks
in legerdemain. I am a stranger in your place
and hope to show you strange things. India is
supposed to be the land of magic and the home of
the conjuror, but India itself has never invented
anything equal to that which I propose to do before
your astonished eyes tonight. The first trick
is one of my own invention, and one which no
other man in the world than myself has ever successfully
performed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Five years ago I offered one thousand dollars
to any man who could do it, and tonight I will
double the offer. I will give two thousand dollars
in cold cash to the individual who will do the
trick, and grant him full privilege to watch me
while I am working.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is this wonderful feat? I will tell you,
gentlemen. I propose to take a loaf of bread, a
common, every-day loaf of bread, and right here,
before your very eyes, turn it into a horse, a real,
prancing, living, breathing horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was at Newton the other night, and while
preparing to do the trick a man in the audience interrupted
me by saying to one of his friends, ‘Bill,
I know how he does it. He’s got that horse up his
sleeve.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, in order to convince my audience that
there was no truth in the explanation, I shall,
while doing this feat, take off my coat and roll up
my shirt sleeves. This certainly ought to be
enough to convince the most skeptical.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have just sent for a loaf of bread,” (after a
few whispered words the “local” musician had
suddenly taken his departure) “and while the
young man is gone, allow me to talk for a few
moments concerning a little article I have with me
here, an article by the assistance of which, in reality,
I do some of my most singular feats.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Understand, gentlemen, I am not going to
sell these articles, but intend to give them away to
those fortunate individuals who apply before the
limited supply is exhausted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The instrument is known as the Microscopic
Look-Back, and was an original invention of my
own while I was on the detective police force. The
only reason why I don’t sell them is because the
law forbids me doing so. But, my friends, in this
great and glorious land of ours, which lies under
the stars and stripes, where every man is free and
endowed with certain inalienable rights, there is
no law which can stop my giving them away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can the better explain to you the benefits of
this little instrument by giving some practical
illustrations of its use.”</p>

<p class='c012'>While putting up this talk I would be holding in
my hands the neat little box with its internal mirror,
and now I would place it to my eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will ask some gentleman back of me to do
something. With the aid of this instrument I will
tell him what he did. Somebody behind me, please
do something.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, there is a gentleman raising his right
hand. He now lowers it and raises his left. He
now closes his first two fingers, and is laughing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There on his right is another gentleman who is
raising his hat. He is putting it on again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I would go on like this for perhaps five minutes,
the actions of the persons behind me increasing in
interest and complexity; then I would continue:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, gentlemen, this little instrument, as you
may imagine, can be used in a great many different
ways besides seeing through the back of your
head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You might wish to follow some one without
being seen. If the object of your chase should
turn a block ahead, you would not have to follow.
You could simply stand on the corner, hold your
little box back at an angle of about twenty degrees—in
this manner—and it would bring every object
on that street to your eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you are suspicious of your best girl, and
want to watch the other fellow while he calls on
her, don’t sneak up to the house and peep through
the window. Take your little Look-Back, place
this end to the keyhole and your eye at the other
and the entire surroundings will be disclosed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The little box which you see in my hands has
within it such a combination of lenses and glasses,
all arranged in such a scientific way, that they
throw a picture of objects to the center of the box,
where they are exposed to the eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you want to watch an eclipse you can do so
with this little Look-Back; and if you want to
sight the smallest thing at the longest distance,
there you have it. And, by the way, if you want
to gaze on the smiling countenance of your best
girl without using the keyhole, or being seen, just
place yourself directly under her window, use this
little instrument, and I don’t care if she lives forty
stories high you can spot her every time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The bad boy got hold of one of these and discovered
a new use for it. He looked through the
wrong end at a lamp post, and found that it
turned the post upside down. Would you believe
it, gentlemen, after that he stood on the street corner,
gazing at the passers-by, and had every man,
woman and child walking upside down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, I don’t want any of you to do the
same thing, because it would be unfair and
wouldn’t be nice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, before I begin to hand them out, I wish
to show you an article that is related to the Look-Back,
and, in fact, goes with it. It is a microscope—not
like the ordinary ones, but one that magnifies
one hundred thousand times larger, according
to its size and power, than anything that has ever
been discovered. It is something every man should
own, from the fact that he can make it pay for
itself a thousand times over.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In buying your groceries, for instance, you can
discover any and all adulterations by its aid. The
same with the water which you drink—any impurities
in it can be easily seen.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you buy a suit of clothes, the microscope
comes in handy again, for by its aid you can find
out whether your clothes are all wool, or mixed
with cotton. If you need a sunglass, or want to
do anything which requires an acuteness of sight
beyond the limit of the human eye, you can be assisted
by the microscope.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are a thousand and one other uses for
this little instrument, but you all know what it is
and it is needless for me to go into any further
statement of its merits.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish to explain that I am here to introduce
these microscopes, and that I have orders to place
them with every drug and jewelry store in your
city. The price will be from two to three dollars,
and if you wish them after I am gone you can get
them from your local dealers at those figures.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going to sell them tonight, however, for
the purpose of introduction, and for the small sum
of twenty-five cents; and with every microscope
that is sold I will give one of these valuable Look-Backs,
free of charge. The first man who passes
me up a quarter gets a pair of these valuable articles.
Thank you, sir; you break the ice, and for
the rest of your life you will be thanking me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The quarters began to roll in, and my local talent
was kept busy in helping me keep track of the
people in the crowd who wanted to be customers.
They had already helped me out in “looking backward,”
but the musician I had sent for a loaf of
bread must have forgotten me, since he never returned.
Of course, I never actually attempted to
do the trick, but used the patter to interest the
crowd, and if asked for it would make some comical
excuse which would raise a laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “Look-Backs” cost me fifty cents per dozen
and the microscopes fifty-eight.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course, it would take up too much time to
tell of all my wanderings and my numerous ups
and downs. My idea is not to give more than one
experience with any particular line of business,
and in that show just how I worked, and indicate
about what was my percentage of profit.</p>

<p class='c012'>I worked off the stock of goods sent me C. O. D.
by my friend, the professor, bought a number
of other stocks on my own account, and covered
considerable territory. If my success was great,
however, my personal expenses were large. I
was not naturally an extravagant man, had not
very well remembered the lessons of economy, and
wealth did not accumulate in my hands as rapidly
as the reader might suppose.</p>

<p class='c012'>One morning I woke up with nothing special on
my hands, and just three hundred dollars in my
pockets. Impelled by what was probably a whim
to start in some permanent business, I went to the
town of Marshall, Georgia, on a prospecting tour.
I saw no opening there which impressed me favorably,
until, while I was waiting undecided what to
do, I met the manager of a theatrical company
which had just stranded in a neighboring city.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a little conversation, an idea struck me,
which I immediately carried into effect. I made
my arrangements with the manager for himself
and the six female members of the company, giving
the gentleman enough money to get out of
town. I rented a large hall, and opened it up as
an original museum. We put the six ladies on
exhibition as the principal and, in fact, the only
attraction, advertising them as six beautiful
widows in search of husbands.</p>

<p class='c012'>Each exhibition was interspersed with little orations,
in which we gave the ages and pedigrees of
the different ladies, together with the amount of
cash each one had in her own right. Every eligible
single gentleman was entitled to registration by
name or number—or by both—as a candidate for
the hand of the lady he might select, and we
started in with the number something like 22,911.
The choice of the lady was to be made at the end
of the season.</p>

<p class='c012'>The widows looked very charming in their
fancy full dress costumes, and did several dignified
“turns” in singing and legitimate theatricals,
proving a great drawing card, with the sterner
sex. For a while the dimes and quarters came
rolling in pretty fast, but eventually the novelty
began to wear off and the audiences thinned out,
so that I decided to shift my field of operations.
My expenses had really been heavier than I knew.
The manager gambled and lost a great deal of our
capital; the various widows had divided up into
pairs, each jealous of the others. The brightest
lady of the troupe fell sick of a fever, the most
beautiful one eloped with a worthless actor, one
was really married to a planter residing in the
neighborhood of Marshall, who bravely followed
her up and cut her out from under my very nose,
and two more “silently stole away” the very night
of the walking of the ghost, leaving me with just
a remnant of one charming widow on my hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fearful lest I might be led into the only apparently
legitimate outcome, that of marrying the
unexpended balance, I left that lady the entire
remnant of my fortune, amounting in all to about
forty dollars, only reserving enough to get me out
of town, and then ran away myself. It had taken
about four months to find out that, though my
ideas might be both original and good, I was not
cut out for a successful museum manager. I quit
the business a sadder and wiser man.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that time the business of securing “free
transportation” had not been brought down to the
present fine point. Perhaps one reason was that
most any person with a plausible excuse and the
gall to apply could secure a pass from New Orleans
to Halifax.</p>

<p class='c012'>In my hours of prosperity, of course, I paid my
fare over the railroads, the same as any other millionaire;
when stranded I only walked when it
was impossible to ride.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no special ingenuity displayed in
beating the railroad, as long as my baggage had
been forwarded by express, and I was not fastidious
about my surroundings. Of course, there
was a strong probability of being “ditched” before
reaching destination, but that was part of the
game. Occasionally I borrowed a box-car or rode
the “blind baggage.” In moments of dark adversity,
I was ready to try a brake beam or find a
hiding place in the back part of the tender. I have
ridden on top of a passenger coach, in the manger
of a palace horse car, and even taken a flyer on the
pilot of an express train. Once, when I was hard
up and it was of vital importance for me to reach
a town where a prepaid package of goods was
awaiting me, I boldly went into a smoking car
where there were four men sitting in seats facing
each other. They had been traveling for some
time and were going a long distance. The conductor
had stuck his checks in the bands of their
hats, and was not likely to pay them more than
passing attention. As I entered, one of them got
up and went out. I immediately dropped into his
seat, and, taking off my hat, was busily engaged
reading a newspaper when the conductor came
around. Nine times out of ten this risky plan
would have been a failure, but my lucky star happened
to be in the ascendant, the conductor mistook
me for the other fellow and passed me by.
Before he noticed it I had reached my destination.
I tried no such scheme as this at Marshall, however.
I simply went out on the blind baggage.
There may, indeed, have been a door in the front
end—in those days there generally was—but, if
so, it made no difference. I sat on the steps of the
first platform and evaded the lynx-eyed glances
of the captain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just how I got to Mobile I’ll never tell you, but
get there I did, and it took me several weeks to
do so.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that moment I was almost ready to forswear
my occupation and settle down into the permanent
and legitimate; but, alas, no opening presented
itself, and I was forced to fall back on my wits.
Luck had for some time been dead against me, and
several promising schemes failed to work. I suppose
I did not put soul enough into them. I had
been living on free lunches longer than I cared to
remember, and was growing desperate.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was certainly game afoot somewhere, if
I could only find it, and I strolled down, at last, to
a part of the city where the colored population was
largely concentrated. There I caught sight of an
immense colored woman, and at once evolved a
scheme. I went over, did some lively talking, and
in the end struck up a bargain. There were a few
dimes yet in my pocket, which I spent for muslin
and the hire of a hack to bring her up in triumph
to an empty store-room which I had hired without
permission.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have already alluded to my knack of sign
making and lettering. For a few pennies I procured
the loan of a paint pot, and fell to work on
a gigantic banner for a place on the outer wall. It
ran like this:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“The Animated Chocolate Drop!”</div>
    <div>See the Curiosity of the Age!</div>
    <div>This Is</div>
    <div>The Biggest, Blackest, Ugliest</div>
    <div>Thing You Ever Saw.</div>
    <div>Living, Breathing, Seeing, Speaking,</div>
    <div>Chunk of</div>
    <div>5,000 Pounds.</div>
    <div>One Sight Will Be a Joy for a Lifetime!</div>
    <div>Walk In.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With this I covered the bay window on the outside,
thus making it serve the double purpose of
advertisement and curtain. Then, taking my
stand at the door, I fell to work.</p>

<p class='c012'>A good many people were passing that way,
and with my knowledge of human nature it was
not hard to pick out half a dozen of the right sort
for free admission. Securing these as a start for
an audience, I began my outside oration on the animated
chocolate drop, the mountain of flesh,
the visible evolution of the protoplastic through
the missing link of Darwin’s chain. I talked of
the baboons of Sumatra and the Dyaks of Borneo;
of the chimpanzee of Abyssinian deserts and
the gorilla of the Congo—“And all this lesson
to be learned for the small sum of half a dime.
The lecture itself is worth the money, and the
sight of the chocolate drop would be cheap at a
fortune.”</p>

<p class='c012'>What my audience thought I never knew nor
cared, so long as they did not mob me. It is an
actual fact that over two hundred people paid a
nickel a piece to see the wonder of the age—which
was only old “auntie” from Smoky Row, throned
on the counter and feeling as big as a box-car.
After deducting expenses I divided fairly with
the old woman, sending her home again in a hack,
while I proceeded to leave the neighborhood as
soon as possible, before the questions of rent or
trespass and license should come up. It seemed a
miracle that I had not been stranded on one of
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>But here I was, after the briefest of business
adventures, with five dollars in my pocket, and
again at a loss. That evening I once more ran
over the list of my available accomplishments, to
see which one was most applicable, and happened
to think of one which had been escaping my mind.
What was to prevent my pursuing the vocation
of a corn doctor?</p>

<p class='c012'>True enough, my knowledge was theoretical
rather, than practical, having been gleaned from a
few incidental remarks made by Professor Carter;
but I thought I remembered all he had said
on the subject, and was sure that anything more
would be confusing. I decided to launch out the
next morning and test for myself the possibilities
of the profession.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the outset, I may as well premise that as a
corn doctor I was a miserable failure, and after
the first day’s experience never had the nerve to
attempt the scheme again. I had none too much
confidence in the start, and before the day’s work
was done had mentally vowed that the corn doctor
was the most worthless piece of mechanism
ever manufactured.</p>

<p class='c012'>The day bid fair to be blazing hot, and the
chances were that before getting through I would
be hotter. I went along, trying to muster up
courage, and laughing at myself for a cowardice
which I had never felt since breaking the ice with
calling cards. What troubled me was the fact
that my inexperienced hand would most likely be
employed, if at all, on the corns and bunions of
the sweeter sex, and I felt shy of presenting myself
as a spectacle for their roguish or discriminating
eyes. Door after door I passed, and at
each one my courage failed me and I went on with
a muttered “not yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This will never do,” I said to myself at length.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At the fifth house from this I stop and begin
work. Rich or poor, young or old, high or low,
no matter what state or condition of men, women
or children I may meet with, I intend to extract
their corns, eradicate their bunions, and obtain the
full market price for my services.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The fifth house was a neat cottage and the name
of Higbie was on the door. I rang the bell and a
young lady appeared at the threshold.</p>

<p class='c012'>Good heavens! If it had been her grandmother
the case would have been bad enough, but I confess
the sight of this beautiful young lady, with
the big blue eyes and the lovely golden hair, frizzled
all over her head in some bewildering manner,
broke my nerve at the very outset. I felt an
immediate desire to ask for a glass of water, but
remembered that I had exhausted that racket in
my Chicago experience, and came to business as
well as I could.</p>

<p class='c012'>The longer I thought of those wide blue eyes
which were on me, the more confused and excited
I became, and the less inclined I felt to break the
ice, though I knew it had to be done in some way.
When, at length, in a very sweet voice, she asked
what I wanted, I blurted out:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you want to buy any corns today? Ah—oh,
no—I don’t mean that. I wanted to ask if you
had any corns in here. That is—are you—no—so
to speak—I am a corn doctor, selling corns,
bunions and ingrowing toe nails. I have only a
few more left of the same sort, and I am disposing
of them ridiculously cheap.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And right then I brought up with a short turn.
I had started in on the wrong string, and for the
life of me could not stop until I had made a mess
of it. When I realized what I had done I stammered
a little and was speechless. Somehow, that
young lady affected me as no young woman ever
did, before or since.</p>

<p class='c012'>She seemed to notice my predicament, for she
said, very sweetly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you are a corn doctor, are you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, miss, I am—a graduate of the Entaw
Chiropedic Institution, and with seven years’ experience.
Corns, as you know, are divided into
two classes—the curable and the incurable, the
latter being most generally found on the feet of
persons well advanced in life, though sometimes
affecting the younger. Under the new system
their removal is practically painless and but the
work of a moment. A bare glance is sufficient to
decide as to the treatment required. If there are
any corns in this household I shall be happy to inspect
them, and until the operation is decided on
the consultation will not cost you a cent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once started, my confounded glib tongue ran
away with me. Before I knew it I had Miss Higbie—that
was her name, Miss Mattie Higbie—converted
to my way of thinking. While I was
talking I gradually edged my way into the house,
and when I politely suggested she show me the
corn she had admitted the ownership of, she consented
without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alas! the work of my tongue was more artistic
than the work of my hand. I must have still been
bewildered, for on seeing that corn I fell on it in
haste, and without preliminary exhortations tore
it out by the roots.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had said the operation would be painless. On
the contrary, the pain was so intense that the
young lady gave a scream and fell back fainting.</p>

<p class='c012'>I did not lose my wits as completely as I might
have done, but, raising her head, I shouted for
water. Mrs. Higbie came running into the room
with a whole basin full, which she dashed into
Miss Mattie’s face, and under this heroic treatment
the young lady began to revive. I have since
wondered whether she had entirely fainted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You horrid man,” she exclaimed, faintly; “I
just allowed you to look at my corn. Nobody said
you might jerk it out. I shan’t pay you a cent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I tell you,” shouted Mrs. Higbie, “that
you had better be getting away from here before
I get a bucket of hot water. If I get a scald on
you the hair will come off, bristles and all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From which I judged she was acquainted with
the implements and process of hog killing, and
that it was time for me to leave. I slipped out of
the house speechless, made my way to the hotel,
and vowed this was the last time I would ever pose
as a corn doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'>That evening the landlord, or the hotel clerk, or
whoever was running the caravanserai I stopped at,
got me in a corner, and before the interview was
ended I was broke. Not only broke, but dead-broke.
By that time he had heard of some of the
schemes I had worked, or tried to work, but worst
of all a report had reached him of my late exploit
as a corn doctor. After collecting all that was due
him, completely emptying my pockets, he informed
me that his hotel could shelter me no
longer, and that if I wanted to avoid a coat of tar
and feathers it would be well for me to leave the
city on the first train. As an afterthought he
handed me a letter, which had come for me to the
hotel during my absence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Through all my wanderings I had kept in pretty
close touch with the old folks at home, and usually
I was glad enough to receive a letter dated from
the spot I loved so well.</p>

<p class='c012'>But this made me mad rather than glad, and
yet the tidings in it were pleasant enough. My
sister was to be married soon, and sent an urgent
request, backed by both father and mother, that I
should return home in time for her wedding.</p>

<p class='c012'>You can imagine my feelings. Here I was,
hundreds of miles from home, without a cent in
my pockets, or a roof in sight under which I
might lay my head, and the folks at home were rejoicing
in my prosperity and inviting me to a
wedding.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus far my life had been a pretty stormy one.
I had worked numberless schemes, visited towns
by the hundred, and had experience by the cubic
ton, but I had no money. By this time, too, I
scarcely had decent clothes. When I began to
figure the whole thing over, and thought of my
sister’s approaching marriage, and how I would
like to be there to see the old folks and all the
neighbors, I tell you right now I was pretty blue.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was, of course, an impossibility to get home,
and I decided to write a letter telling them so, giving
some plausible excuse if I could think of one,
but the more I thought of my present condition
the madder I got. I finally rose up and shook myself
together.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look here, old boy,” I thought to myself,
“this will never do. The world is large, other people
are making a living in it, and more than a living.
There is money enough going, and all that
you want to do is to see that you get your share.
Here goes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I took a start toward the office door, and it
seems it was a relief to mine host.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hope you don’t go away mad,” he said, “but
the fact is, I can’t afford to have a lynching party
raid my hotel. Don’t tell anyone I warned you,
but get out of sight as soon as possible. The wonder
is the crowd is not here now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I made no great haste, but I certainly did not
linger, and it is an actual fact that before I had got
two squares away the crowd had commenced to
gather and I could hear someone shouting, “Bring
out the blamed rascal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no use for me to go to the railroad
station. Indeed, that was the very place for me to
avoid. Without a doubt, the landlord would give
the gang the tip that I had promised to leave town
by the next train, and they would look for me
there. There was no train leaving for at least an
hour, and in that time a great deal that was unpleasant
could happen.</p>

<p class='c012'>In my penniless condition, and with such
trouble imminent, I knew that my best plan was to
get out of town and into the country; and not only
that, but to get as far away as I could in the shortest
time possible, trusting to finding something on
the road to keep the mill of life going until luck
took a more friendly turn.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fortunately, I got away without personal damage,
and before long was plodding along the country
road, safe but sullen, and it was some time before
my face took on its usual smiling expression
and I become again the debonnaire soldier of fate.</p>

<p class='c012'>The change which turned my fortunes occurred
in this way:</p>

<p class='c012'>I heard behind me the rattle of wheels and the
swift stepping of horses. Looking back over my
shoulder I saw a two-horse wagon, with a falling
top over the seat in front, coming towards me at
a clipping gait.</p>

<p class='c012'>The driver drew up a trifle as he neared me and
I braced up sufficiently to ask him for a ride.</p>

<p class='c012'>Without hesitating to consider, he came to a
full stop and I climbed in. The tide had turned
again and I was to get the advantage of its flow.
We soon became very congenial, and when we
had exchanged confidences, and I had suggested
that I was open for an engagement, my newly-made
friend fell in with the idea at once. He was
a fakir himself, at present in the patent medicine
business, traveling with his own rig.</p>

<p class='c012'>It did not take us long to reach an understanding.
For the present he was to pay my expenses
in return for my assistance, and I was to be at
liberty to work my side schemes when not engaged
about his affairs.</p>

Fake—The Electric Battery
and Money—Fun with Crowd on the Street—Selling
Pipes and Giving Watches Away—Fooling
the Farmers—The Circus, Turnips
and the Elephant—Working the
Hotel Landlords.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>Once more I had fallen in with a doctor, and
though I never considered him as finished an operator
as Prof. Carter, he was certainly one of the
smoothest men I ever met. He worked his rackets
after what were then largely new methods,
though now they may seem old enough to most
people.</p>

<p class='c012'>He drove a very lively team, for which I soon
found there was a reason, and that he had the
strength and the skill to control it. He always
had half a dozen fakes on tap, and when the hour
did not seem ripe for one he tried another. By
this time I considered myself a pretty good workman,
and was really the glibber talker, but he
undertook and carried through schemes which I
would hardly then have cared to tackle, though I
have made money out of some of them since. His
wagon was light running, easy riding, and built
for his business. It must have cost him a very
pretty penny to have it prepared, but he certainly
made his profit out of it, in working various
things, one of which being what, in conversation
with me, he called “the battery scheme.” It was
the most complicated fake I had up to that time
ever met with, but it had its drawbacks, and I
often wondered that Doctor Munson had never
been shot. There is nothing that makes the average
man madder than to be laughed at by a crowd
for being fooled when he thinks he has a sure
thing. Yet, the doctor simply made an offer without
any explanations, and if the fools were silly
enough to believe that he was going to give them
all there was in sight, and took him up in the
blind, they deserved to lose a little coin and much
self-respect.</p>

<p class='c012'>The doctor had a small flight of stairs covered
with copper, which could be placed so that it led
into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the carriage was a nice little copper-covered
table, or stand, and the stairway and table would
be connected with a galvanic battery at the bottom
of the carriage. On the table would be displayed
several stacks of coin, of different denominations,
ranging from one to twenty dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>While addressing the crowd the doctor would
carelessly finger the money, showing that it was
perfectly loose. He would close his remarks by
saying that any man who would give him twenty-five
cents would receive permission to come up
into the wagon, and all the money he could scoop
up in one grab would be his own. After that he
would turn a button, which established the circuit
with the battery, and wait for victims. With
his persuasive tongue he was pretty certain to obtain
them, but the moment that one tried to step
from the stairway to the wagon he would form a
connection for conducting the galvanic circuit
through his body, and it operated so strongly that
it would be impossible for the man to take anything;
he was only too glad to get away alive.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, the circuit could be turned off by the
doctor, without the action being seen by the
crowd, and there were some places where the
whole thing remained a totally unexplained mystery.
Half of the audience would declare the
poor, miserable victims were in collusion with the
doctor, and could reach the money if they tried to,
while the other half thought the fun of the thing
was worth twenty-five cents, and would yell with
laughter every time a man would step up the copper
stairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>As I was to be his assistant, Dr. Munson explained
to me his methods, and we had several rehearsals
along the road, though I soon convinced
him that there was not much difference between
Jack and his master.</p>

<p class='c012'>At times he made two trips through the section
of the country, if it seemed likely to prove profitable.
On the first trip he was careful what he
said and did, so that there would be nothing to
interfere with his coming again. He then carried
the “Pain Balm,” good for internal as well as external
application. He seldom attempted to sell
a bottle, but left it with every responsible person
he could get to accept the trust. The understanding
was that if the individual meantime had
found no need for the article, or did not care to
purchase, Munson was to take it back on his next
call. The price was one dollar a bottle, and the
holder was at liberty to try the medicine in case
he had need of it, and if it did not prove satisfactory
the bottle could still be returned, provided
the contents were not one-quarter gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Usually, when the doctor came, at the expiration
of about three weeks, three-fourths of the
bottles would be returned. Even at that the
scheme was good for ordinary profits, and when
used in connection with street faking in the towns
it helped the business amazingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have said that I had some knowledge of
music. The doctor carried several instruments
with him, and when we had practiced together
for about a week we were able to give quite an
interesting entertainment, not only drawing, but
holding a large concourse of people. After that
there were several methods of handling them.
Before we had been traveling together a month
I knew them all and one or the other of us would
do the work, just as it happened.</p>

<p class='c012'>For instance: The crowd gathered and we
started in by announcing to the good people that
to every one who patronized us we would give a
piece of pie.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then I gave a strong talk on the merits of the
medicine, and began to offer it for sale. It was a
very cold day if I had not struck some purchasers
in the audience, who had a quarter of a dollar—or
fifty cents—to throw away, and a curiosity to
see what the “pie” looked like. With every bottle
or package I sold I would take the quarter received,
add another to it, and place them in an
envelope. This was done before their eyes, and
as I threw the money in a little box I would remark,
“There goes a piece of pie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After selling a dozen or fifteen packages at a
quarter each, I would call up every man who had
made a purchase and return his quarter, with the
other quarter added to it, remarking as I did so:</p>

<p class='c012'>“There, sir, is your piece of pie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I would then start selling fifty-cent packages,
and with every one sold would put the money,
and an extra half, in the box as before, and subsequently
returning the double portion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Apparently, we had money in inexhaustible
quantities, and were willing to scatter it freely.
By this time the crowd was entirely with us. We
had what some people call the magnetic influence
firmly established, and the closer the people
packed together the stronger it worked. The man
who does not believe in the possibility of getting
something for nothing is a rara avis; most any
gudgeon will bite at the idea of doubling his
money without risk or labor. I would begin to
sell one dollar packages, adding two dollars to
every one sold, and on calling the customers up
to the carriage I returned them their dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time I had the crowd worked up to the
proper pitch, and I would start to selling five-dollar
and ten-dollar packages. With the money
received for each five-dollar package I would
place a ten-dollar gold piece, and with every ten
dollars a twenty-dollar gold piece, the people supposing,
of course, that it was going to be “pie.”
You will notice I made no promise beyond that of
giving them “pie,” and to that word they attached
their own significance.</p>

<p class='c012'>After I had sold the last bottle I would clear
my throat and say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, gentlemen, before distributing this pie,
which, I admit, is largely intended to advertise
the most successful remedy ever placed on the
market, I wish to make a few closing remarks
about my business.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are selling this medicine strictly on its
merits, which we consider unsurpassed. If there
is any man in this crowd who has purchased for
any other reason than for its actual merits, I want
that man to step right up here and get his money
back. I want to impress you with the fact, even
though I may be a street fakir, that I am an honest
man, and, if I am aware of it, will never deal
with a dishonest person, or one who doubts the
quality of the goods I sell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I also desire to add that if there is any one who
questions the legitimacy of our advertising, who
thinks it has been money thrown away, or so unscrupulous
or dishonest as to patronize me with
the sole purpose of beating a poor street fakir, I
ask him as a white man and a gentleman to come
up here, get his money back and return the medicine
before I distribute the ‘pie.’ Others who
would use the article are vainly waiting to purchase,
and this manly course may save some valuable
life in the near future. As for men of the
other class, I neither ask their money, nor want
their patronage.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there would be a pause. Of course, no
one would come up, and I would conclude by saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I promised every man who patronized me a
piece of pie, and I am going to keep my word.
The money is put in an envelope, and every gentleman
who invested in the late sale will step up
to the carriage, show his package and receive his
pie.</p>

<p class='c012'>They would come crowding around, and after
the doctor and I had distributed the envelopes
with lightning rapidity, the driver would whip up
the horses and we would go away at a gallop.</p>

<p class='c012'>The last envelopes we handed out contained
only nickles.</p>

<p class='c012'>It takes nerve, of course, to do such work, and
it did not do to repeat it often in the same part of
the state, as news of it extended rapidly and to
quite a distance. That made no difference to us.
In the outset, it was agreed that I was to be at
liberty to work my own side lines, and though I
soon was recognized as a partner, rather than as
an assistant, and was paid very fairly, I did not
altogether neglect my private interests. Amongst
other things, I had sent me, as soon as I had obtained
a little more capital, a lot of imported
pipes. They were made in Germany and were a
close imitation of real meerschaum. Each had a
neat imitation amber mouthpiece, and was packed
in a dark paper case. The pipes were small, made
in fancy designs, and cost me two dollars and a
half a dozen. I made my profit by disposing of
them between the legitimate sales of our medicine.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had, also, some very pretty ladies’ watches,
gold plated, which I had bought for four dollars
and a half each. With every twelve pipes sold I
raffled off one of these watches, proceeding in a
manner entirely original with me, as I shall explain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the doctor had been fairly successful
with medicine. Then we would give a little musical
interlude, and I would come forward. I
would open with a nonsensical story, old now, but
which was certainly very effective then. I had a
dozen of them pat for every occasion, and by keeping
an ear open for local news could make at least
the opening of my address sound very appropriate.
For instance, if I had heard of a runaway
that created some little excitement I would begin
like this:</p>

<p class='c012'>“While walking down your street this afternoon
I was witness to a fearful runaway.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In a wagon drawn by a powerful and spirited
team of horses was a man, with a couple whom I
took to be his wife and child. At a glance I
judged the man to be intoxicated, though perhaps
I was mistaken. He was applying his whip
in a frantic manner, as though to test the speed
of his team right there in the public street, and
the more he whipped the horses the faster they
ran, and the more unmanageable they became.
They kept going faster and faster and faster,
until they looked like a whirlwind of horse flesh
and a regular tornado of wagon fixtures. I heard
the screams of the frightened woman, and the
shrill cry of the terrified child. But I was powerless
to reach them, and, gazing with clasped
hands, could only whisper: ‘God help them.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Under such circumstances a catastrophe was
inevitable, and it was not long in coming. In
their madness the horses dashed into a lamp-post,
wrecking the wagon and hurling the man, woman
and child far into the street.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Providentially, as it might seem, not one of
them was seriously injured, and the man, rising
to his feet, began to swear over the ruins. The
body of the wagon was in kindling wood, and
one of the wheels, wrenched from its bearings,
lay beside it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A policeman unaccountably happened to be
on the spot and took in the situation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Without saying a word he picked up the
wheel and marched with it to the station house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was a touch beyond me, and I have had
considerable experience with the working of the
average policeman’s brain. I couldn’t for the life
of me understand what he meant by his action.
My curiosity was aroused, and I followed for the
purpose of investigation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Walking up to the officer, I said, ‘Mr. Policeman,
what in the world was your idea in arresting
that wheel?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“He answered, “I did it because it was off its
nut.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Having jollied the people into a good humor by
something like the foregoing, I would come down
to the serious business of selling my pipes and
raffling off the watches which went with them.</p>

<p class='c012'>I made a long talk on the watches, telling of the
various processes they underwent before they
could be called perfect timepieces—of the delicate
hairspring, and the tiny, intricate mechanism enclosed
in the case. Before I got through, it was
safe to say that every man in the crowd wanted a
watch for his wife or daughter, mother or sister,
to say nothing of his best girl, if he had one. The
pipes spoke for themselves, but my little oration
included a fair description of their merits, and I
usually had little difficulty in disposing of the
dozen of them allotted to any particular evening,
and I might add that both sides were well satisfied.
The pipes were very good while they lasted,
and the watch went like a daisy—as long as the
wheels turned round. I made good money out of
the invoice, and in after days handled the same
line of goods more than once.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am sorry to say, the doctor was something of
a beat. Though he always treated me fairly
enough, all the rest of mankind seemed to be considered
his legitimate game, while the plunder of
a landlord was his special delight. He had capital
enough at his command, but it appeared to me
that he would sooner save fifty cents off his hotel
bill than to make five dollars selling medicine,</p>

<p class='c012'>To tell the truth, I had not much sympathy
with the average country landlord, and was not
strongly averse to working him myself. He feeds
his local trade for twenty-five cents per meal, and
when an outsider calls charges him fifty cents or
a dollar for the same thing. You can safely conclude
that however much a tale of woe may induce
him to scale his prices, he is still making a living
profit.</p>

<p class='c012'>When we arrived at a hotel the doctor would
ask for the tariff sheet. If he was told it was two
dollars a day he would state that he was no commercial
drummer, working on salary with expenses
allowed, but just an ordinary vendor on
his own account, who, in these hard times, found
that to make both ends meet was a pretty tough
proposition. Furthermore, that he was paying
his own way, and couldn’t stand the two dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>As a result he would sometimes get rates as low
as one dollar a day, for each of us.</p>

<p class='c012'>When we were ready to go, the doctor would
ask for his bill, and then tell Mr. Landlord that
business had been bad, that he had been obliged to
pay a C.O.D. express bill, and that being about
“flat broke” he did not see how he was to pay his
account unless the landlord agreed to take it out
in medicine at wholesale prices.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, there would be a kick, and he would
go on with another proposition.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll tell you what I can do, Mr. Landlord. I’ve
got with me over thirty dollars worth of silverware
that I was going to deliver to a lady in the
next town. She ordered it from me the last time I
was along. As I put up the money for it, I guess
it’s still mine to do what I want with, and if you’ll
take that and call it square, you can have it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlord would be a little interested at that,
and the doctor would show him the silverware.
Once get the man to looking at it, the rest followed.
It made a good showing, and the doctor
talked so artistically about the price, quality, etc.,
that the deal would almost invariably be closed.
What that silverware cost it is unnecessary to say,
but he always made a fair profit out of the operation.
He even sometimes wound up by selling for
cash some silver polish or insect exterminator.
He always had a full line to catch the landlords,
even if other things ran short, I took note of
these things and never forgot them. When traveling
exclusively on my own account I used the
same dodge, or some other closely akin to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a great deal of humor about the doctor,
and he was sometimes inclined to be a trifle
revengeful. Here is a case in point:</p>

<p class='c012'>There was occasionally a town which, work at
answer to our appeals, but the surrounding county
try as we might, would absolutely refuse to do business.
Why this was so, was more than I can explain.
We probably tried harder there than elsewhere,
but some how the conditions were not
right. I remember once in our travels we hit such
a town, and not only did the town refuse to
try was just as bad. We could not even leave a
gratuitous bottle of “Pain Balm” on free trial.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before long we caught on to the fact that from
the flashy appearance of the wagon the farmers
believed it belonged to the circus we had noticed
was advertised to appear at the town the following
week. The doctor made up his mind that that
was the reason. In the moral mind the circus
man is credited with surpassing shrewdness in all
business matters.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the moment the doctor was mad enough,
but he quickly cooled down and determined to
play a little trick on them in return. He quit trying
to sell goods, and became a buyer. The fields
were fairly stocked with turnips and he told every
farmer he could meet that he was purchasing
agent for the circus, representing that he was out
contracting for turnips to feed the elephants. I
am afraid to say how many wagon-loads it took
daily to supply the needs of the show, but he
offered enormous prices for turnips by the wagon-load
to be delivered at the show grounds on the
day of the circus.</p>

<p class='c012'>We never knew the exact outcome, but many a
laugh did we have imagining it. The loads of
turnips hauled into town that day must have been
a caution, even if not more than half the farmers
fulfilled their contracts. Of course, the circus
people would not take the vegetables; but I afterwards
heard that the manager, seeing a chance for
a big local gag and advertisement, kindly took
them all into the big tent and seated them together
in the reserved corner, where the clown
could point them out when he told the great joke
of the farmers, the elephants and the turnips.</p>

<p class='c012'>But if those medicine men had showed their
faces again in that neighborhood I think the
farmers would have killed them, and torn their
bodies into fragments as small as turnip seeds.</p>

<p class='c014'>The doctor was not by any means a lazy man,
yet he believed, so long as business was prosperous,
in taking his rest and ease for a fair share of
the day. If he came in at night, after a good lot
of sales on the street, he was ready for bed, unless
he fell in with some congenial spirits, with
whom he might spend an hour or two, “swapping
lies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With me, it was different. I was on the hustle
all the time, from the very moment I got together
a little capital to invest in side lines. I was a
younger man, you see, and had my fortune all to
make, while, from some remarks he occasionally
let fall, I was convinced that somewhere the doctor
carried a very comfortable bank account and
owned a home.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have already spoken of a silver-plating blind.
I was in the habit of working this for all it was
worth, and I found my principal patrons at the
hotels where I stopped. I never overlooked a
chance at a hotel, and I believe that, taking into
account only the places where we made temporary
stops, my profits at such places sometimes overran
our bills.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everybody on the premises was fair game. To
the waitresses, cooks and chambermaids I sold
fancy-box paper, jewelry and different little
trinkets which I knew were worth the offering, as
they would catch their fancy. At night I would
take the key to my room and plate it with the silver
fluid, doing also the brass check attached to
the key.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bringing it down in the morning I would hand
it to the clerk, without saying a word, and he
would hang it on the key rack, or put it in the box.</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlord, coming along in a few moments,
perhaps, would notice the contrast and naturally
mention it.</p>

<p class='c012'>I would then speak up and say that I had silver-plated
the key just for fun, and asked how he
would like to have the balance of them fixed up in
the same way. I would generally wind up by
making a contract to plate all the keys, and sell
him a large bottle of the fluid in addition.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes, at night, I dropped into the saloons
and worked the gamblers there, improving
an opportunity to sell them fake goods peculiar to
their trade.</p>

<p class='c012'>I carried in my pocket fountain pens, pencil
sharpeners and other little novelties, and, when
there was time, cornered any poor mortal I happened
to meet and forced him to listen to an oration
on their merits. I carried, also, tissue paper,
which, when pasted on a pane of glass, gave it the
appearance of being stained.</p>

<p class='c012'>At another time I had a lot of little bird
whistles and other noisy instruments. Without
much trouble I became very expert in their use,
and after that found them good sellers. Whenever
I could strike a crowd and had leisure I
sprung such things on them, and nearly always
to my profit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Glass pens were pretty good articles to handle.
In fact, they were among the neatest and prettiest
novelties I carried. The pen point and holder
were made entirely of glass in different tints, the
effect being very fine. The point was ridged all
around—all sides were alike and the same size,
the ridges narrowing at the end so as to form the
writing point—and the “pen” would hold a good
amount of ink. I claimed one hundred words
could easily be written with a single dip of the
pen, and perhaps I was not so far wrong. This
was one of the best sellers I had, and yielded
enormous profits.</p>

<p class='c012'>Late and early I pushed my side lines; but as
I was always on hand to do my work with the
doctor he made no objections, though he must
have sometimes suspected that my profits were
outweighing his. I am sure he gave me full
credit for being an all-round hustler from Hustlerville.
Eventually he filled his wagon with notions
and sold them on the streets. The authorities
in a sudden spasm of virtue had most everywhere
shut down on the “pie” scheme, and every
householder in the United States appeared to be
provided with a bottle of the Pain Balm.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had less opportunity for my side lines, but as
I was a limited partner in the concern I did not
complain. The profits of any one particular evening
might not be as large as in the medicine trade,
but the general average was about as good, and
the methods of drawing and holding a crowd
were about the same.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was while we were engaged in this venture
that I struck almost, if not altogether, the most
exciting period of my life. The doctor and I
fought the two thousand inhabitants of Logwater
to a finish—and won.</p>

<p class='c012'>The war came about in this way.</p>

<p class='c012'>We drove into the town prepared to sell goods
from the wagon, and had every reason to expect
a prosperous week or more. The merchants, however,
got wind of our coming, and at once were
rebellious. In anticipation they already saw
themselves knocked out by the traveling fakirs,
and got their heads together to devise measures
for putting a stop to the performance.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they had much political influence, and several
of them were members of the body, a meeting
of the city council was called double quick and
an ordinance passed, raising the license for street selling
from three dollars, as it had been, to one
hundred dollars a day.</p>

<p class='c012'>As it was not likely our profits could reach such
a sum, we decided we could not stand the tax,
and therefore rented a store-room. We then took
out a license, hired the local cryer to assist, and
proceeded to sell goods at auction, doing a rattling
good business the first night.</p>

<p class='c012'>This made the merchants madder than ever.
Again the council was called together and a special
ordinance was passed, in which our business
was called that of a traveling auction store, and
it was also made subject to a license of one hundred
dollars a day.</p>

<p class='c012'>This time they had us surely. We could not
stand an expense of that kind, on top of our other
outlays, and had to close up. But I told them,
when the marshal called to announce the action of
the council, that they were not done with us, but
that sooner or later we would get even. And I
guess we did, and in a way they will never forget.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that time the town had no railroad, but in
anticipation of getting one quite a little boom was
being worked up. They had a proposition from
the U. &amp; L. R. R., which offered, in consideration
of a bonus of four thousand dollars per mile, to
lay its rails to Logwater, and fifteen miles beyond,
to a railroad town, on the other side.</p>

<p class='c012'>To extend such aid would require $104,000.00,
and it was proposed to raise this sum by issuing
county bonds. A petition was circulated, asking
for an election, at which the voters should decide
whether or not such bonds should be issued. In
a very short time sufficient signatures were procured
to justify the call for an election, and it was
almost a foregone conclusion that the bonds
would be voted. The proposition of the company
looked fair enough, the railroad would without
doubt prove of great benefit to the county, and
there had so far been very little opposition. Everyone
in town seemed confident and jubilant.</p>

<p class='c012'>The proclamation calling for the election was
issued the very day our store was closed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well,” thought we, “you’ve had your innings;
now we will try and have ours.” We immediately
started in to defeat the bonds.</p>

<p class='c012'>Did we succeed in doing it? Well, let the sequel
tell.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the week we traveled through the country—and
didn’t we speak to every man we met?
We drummed up audiences for evening meetings
in the most convenient school house, where we
showed up Logwater, its authorities and citizens
in the clearest light.</p>

<p class='c012'>On Saturdays we were in Logwater, and talking
all day to the farmers who gathered around.</p>

<p class='c012'>Curbstone oratory? Well, I should smile. We
told them the railroad had offered to build to Logwater
in consideration of city bonds alone (which
was a fact), but that the citizens of that cut-throat
place wanted to saddle the whole thing on the
poor farmers, saving expense to themselves,
though, in fact, the townspeople were the only
ones who would be really benefitted.</p>

<p class='c012'>To make a long story short, we exposed the
whole thing from beginning to end, making it out
as one of the most rotten and bare-faced efforts
at robbery that had ever been conceived of or perpetrated
on an intelligent community. We convinced
the people of the rural districts that the
scheme was not only a disgrace to the county, but
a burning insult to each and every one of them,
which could only be resented by voting on election
day against the bonds.</p>

<p class='c012'>As a side issue, we rang in how the merchants
were robbing them, and as a convincing argument
reminded them of our own experience. Because
we were willing to give the people good goods at
living prices, and for so much less than the monopolists
at Logwater were in the habit of charging,
they had forced us out of town by special license
laws which were simply prohibitive.</p>

<p class='c012'>We worked like troopers, day and night, until
election day came. Then we had our revenge to
its fullest extent. The bonds were defeated by a
small majority.</p>

<p class='c012'>The campaign cost us over a hundred dollars,
but the satisfaction of getting even with those fellows
was worth five times as much. Other companies
have their lines running through the
county, but Logwater has no railroad to this day.</p>

<p class='c012'>We were in the city when the election returns
came in. While the result was still in doubt the
citizens did not seem at all cordial, but we were
not in actual peril of our lives. When, however,
it became certain beyond a doubt that the bonds
were defeated, we were called upon by a deputation,
who announced that if we were seen on the
streets after two hours had elapsed there would
be two dead fakirs.</p>

<p class='c012'>We skipped.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no mistake about the people being
in earnest, and the danger was that as we went
some vicious fellows of the baser sort might follow
with the idea of doing us some bodily damage,
even before the given time had elapsed. Out
in the country we knew we could find plenty of
friends, but there was nothing to keep us in that
vicinity, and the night being fairly bright we
drove along quite merrily for perhaps a dozen
miles. Then, just at the entrance of a small town,
one of the horses broke through a rotten plank on
a culvert, and there was a sudden halt. The doctor
remained in the wagon, but I took a sprawling
leap forward, which landed me on top of the
struggling horses.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fortunately, I was uninjured, though the team
was not as lucky. The horse that went into the
culvert sprained a leg, while the other got a cut
in the hock from a splintered single-tree.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a little tavern right in the center of
the town, and we made our way there as best we
could. The landlord was aroused from a sound
sleep by a most vigorous pounding on the door,
and the porter—for there was one even in this
heaven-forsaken hole—did not show himself at
all until it was time for breakfast, some hours
later. We got the horses into the barn, and by
the light of a lantern took stock of damages.</p>

<p class='c012'>We saw that the team would not be fit to proceed
for some days, and I myself began to feel as
though I had been a trifle shaken up. Consequently,
we resigned ourselves to the inevitable
and went to bed.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was in this little town that we worked a
scheme which seems to have a peculiar fascination
and seldom fails to win out. During the first day
and evening we made a few sales from the wagon,
but the population did not justify a more extended
effort. Though there were a good many
people visiting the tavern during the day, there
were not enough in the town to furnish a working
audience. We got up a lottery at the hotel, however,
which was managed after this fashion:</p>

<p class='c012'>Among our other assets was a fine looking
“gold watch” worth any price you may choose to
put on it, though it actually stood us at about fifteen
dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>One hundred tickets were numbered and placed
in small envelopes. The first number sold for one
cent, the second number for two, the third for
three, and so on up, the last number selling for one
dollar.</p>

<p class='c012'>The penny part of the business was what
caught the people. By the time the horses were
ready to proceed, which was in about two days
more, the whole neighborhood had been worked
up over the brilliant scheme, our eloquence had
not been wasted, the last ticket had been sold, the
watch had gone into the hands of the lucky winner,
and we had raked in our fifty dollars and fifty
cents, so that our stay in that town had not been
altogether fruitless. We not only cleared all expenses,
but went away with a little profit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Afterward I worked the scheme with diamond
rings, custom-made clothing, or any other thing
for which there might be a desire or a demand;
and until the novelty wore off, or the location was
exhausted, it proved very successful.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Catching Suckers—Biting Myself—The
Hospital Nurse and Mail Order Scheme—Working
Saloon Men on Bible Racket.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>As I have already hinted, the work of the fakir
changes with the seasons, and though some winters
it was possible to continue street business
successfully, especially by travel in the south, yet
as a rule I have usually altered my route and plans
to correspond with the climate.</p>

<p class='c012'>My partner was of the same opinion, and late
in the fall turned his face homeward, working as
he went. There had been no friction between
us; he had been very honorable in his division of
the spoils, and I confess I parted from him with
many regrets. We did talk of getting together
again the next spring, but the life of a fakir is
full of uncertainties, so that his best laid plans will
often “gang awry.” I did not see him again for
perhaps half a dozen years.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, one day I came across him very unexpectedly
in the street. He had experienced ups
and downs since our parting, and just then was
rather down than up. He actually tried to work
me with the “pop-corn” racket. That, you know,
is a sort of game of chance, and, like all other
propositions of the kind, when the banker knows
his business, as it is safe to gamble that he does,
the chances, if there are any, remain in his favor.</p>

<p class='c012'>I knew the doctor in a moment, and when he
seemed to put a five-dollar bill into a ball of pop-corn,
which he mixed with half a dozen other
balls and then offered me my choice for a quarter,
I felt like shouting.</p>

<p class='c012'>Instead of that, I gravely handed him the quarter,
appeared to hesitate long over my choice, but
finally selected the ball farthest away from me.</p>

<p class='c012'>What followed was a surprise, for without examining
the ball, or attempting to open it, I
tossed it into the street.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, doc,” I said, “you don’t mean to say
you don’t remember me—Jim Weldon? How has
the world been using you, old man?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He gave me a second glance, and knew me
then fast enough, so we shook hands heartily. He
told me how the failure of a promising legitimate
business venture had put him flat on his back,
but that he had gone to work once more at the
foot of the ladder, hoping by spring to be able to
start on the road again in something of his old
style. Poor fellow. I gave him, at parting, as
big a stake as he would accept, and heard from
him a few months later, when he was preparing
for the campaign, but he died the next summer of
yellow fever.</p>

<p class='c012'>As I have said, the summer campaign had been
successful and I had wealth galore. If I preferred
to do so I could live after a modest fashion until
spring came again without doing a stroke, and I
was once more anxious to get into harness. I
made a short visit home, where they were all glad
to see me, and then started out for a visit to some
of the eastern cities. I not only wanted to see
their methods and style, but to get in closer touch
with the men who largely produced the novelties
by the sale of which I expected to make my living.</p>

<p class='c012'>The trip paid me well. There was not, now,
much of the green country youth in me or my
appearance, but I cut a few eye-teeth nevertheless.
By this time I had taken on age, so that I could
easily pass for a man half a dozen years older than
I really was, and I imagined I was pretty well up
in all the tricks of the trade. But I found that I
had a great many to learn, and I proceeded to
learn them. I discovered that there were plenty
of men in my line who sold nothing but the output
of their brains, and that brought the highest
kind of a price. Also that there were many lines
of business, which I had always taken to be of the
staidest, soberest, most legitimate nature, which,
after all, were handled after the style of the greatest
fakes I had ever handled on the road. Some
of them I decided to try in the future when the
time seemed propitious; others seemed to be a
little overpowering to suit even me.</p>

<p class='c012'>When it was all outgo and no income, of
course, my sight-seeing began to get away with
my money, and though my pocket could stand the
stream for some time to come, I could not bear to
be idle. It was not long before I had mastered
the situation and drifted into an humble effort of
occupation.</p>

<p class='c012'>At first my efforts were largely for the purpose
of experience, and to give me something to do. It
was really in a spirit of fun that I spread my first
nets to catch suckers. It was by no means the
line I had ever expected to follow, but there was
a fascination about it, after I once began to employ
printer’s ink, which led me on until, before
long, I was about as bad as the worst of the class,
while I had the remarkable good fortune of not
being brought up with a round turn. Once in a
while a fellow who gets too fresh falls into the
hands of the police and must answer to the law.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once, in my younger days, I enclosed a dime in
answer to an advertisement which promised to
tell applicants how to travel without paying railroad
fare. The response I got was, “Walk instead
of ride.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This is a fair pattern of many fakes; and to my
great amusement, and somewhat to my profit, I
tested the calibre of a number of them that winter
at a trifling expense. You know the old saying,
“A sucker is born every minute.” I did not consider
myself a sucker by any means, and yet I did
considerable “biting” while I was considering the
ways and means of my brethren of the trade.</p>

<p class='c012'>I may say that my own opinion is, the postal
authorities of those days were neither so keen nor
vigilant as they are now, or these fellows would
not have gotten along without more trouble.
There were not so many, and before I got through
I had traced them out and knew them all. I had
also got myself posted on the advertising sheets
which had the widest circulation, and the best line
of readers. I knew that when an ad. appeared in
their pages, if the scheme was a good one and
the work artistically done, results were pretty apt
to accrue in a short time.</p>

<p class='c012'>What sort of fakes were they? Well, for instance,
how does this strike you? In those days
the Louisiana Lottery was in full swing, and the
fellow who advertised a sure “system” to catch
the capital prize must have made a little fortune.
The answer that he gave me in return for my
dime was: “Hold the winning number.”</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the best ads. I saw was headed, “How
to Make Money Fast.” I sent in ten cents. I received
a little book containing full particulars of
the U. S. mint.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How to make Pantaloons Last” was a catchy
heading, and though I suspected the answer I
dropped another dime in the slot and obtained the
information, “Make the Coat and Vest First.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The last one I tested offered for a dime full instructions
on the subject, “How to Get Rich
Without Working.” I was told to catch suckers,
like they did.</p>

<p class='c012'>That settled it with me. There was nothing to
be learned from the gentry of that ilk, and I began
to cast about with the view of taking this very
sensible advice.</p>

<p class='c012'>I did not propose to rob the people, however,
mentally deciding my suckers should get as little
hook and as much bait as was possible for the
money.</p>

<p class='c012'>I hunted up an intelligent young drug clerk,
who had done some medicine reading in his time,
and who was not averse to making the expenses
of a future course at a medical college by assisting
me to carry out what I had in view. From
the doctor with whom he had been reading he obtained
what was really a first-class prescription
for piles, to which, guided by his knowledge, we
made certain additions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then I inserted the following advertisement:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Free.—A Valuable Remedy for Piles. Free.
Address ‘Retired Hospital Nurse,’ No. 66 N—– St., New York.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Inquiries by mail came pouring in from all over
the country. Most of the correspondents enclosed
postage stamps, and to those who did not
we wrote anyhow, enclosing the prescription. I
wrote to each of them about as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear Sir:—Your favor of recent date just received,
and I take great pleasure in sending you
the prescription, as advertised. I desire to particularly
caution you that it must be used strictly
in accordance with directions. Have it put up at
a place where only first-class drugs are kept. The
articles are so delicate that they must be pure and
fresh.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You may find it difficult to procure a few of
the ingredients named in this prescription, especially
if you reside in a small town. I would inform
you that in such case I have made arrangements
with a reliable pharmacist here, who will
put up the entire prescription and forward it by
express, all charges prepaid, for one dollar and
thirty cents.</p>
<p class='c019'>Yours truly,</p>
<p class='c020'>“<span class='sc'>Hospital Nurse</span>.”</p>

<p class='c021'>As the ingredients I had hinted at as hard to
procure, though they had nice sounding names,
never were heard of by any country druggists;
those who decided to use the prescription according
to the direction invariably sent me their orders,
and I returned them a number one, tip-top
pile remedy, which cost just thirty cents. My
partner got materials at wholesale prices, and
now-a-days every one knows the tremendous
profits at which such things are sold at retail.</p>

<p class='c012'>I did not live economically by any means, but
after I got started this thing more than paid my
expenses, while my friend and partner, the drug
clerk, had enough laid up to insure his diploma
as an M. D., and probably this very day would as
soon think of dying as running a professional advertisement
in a newspaper.</p>

<p class='c012'>I worked this pile scheme until the novelty of
it wore off, and then began to think of hitting the
road again. It was while making the rounds in
New York City, looking for something to handle,
that I accidentally strolled into a trade auction
house.</p>

<p class='c012'>I made a purchase there, which, for a time, I
feared was going to turn out a total loss. I
bought three hundred and eighty pocket bibles.
My bid was made “for fun,” and when they were
knocked down to me at a ridiculously low price I
had to take them, though I had no idea of how
they were going to be disposed of. I was not exactly
the sort of individual, either in manner or
appearance, to travel around selling the good
book; and I had my doubts if I could get rid of
them, even if I tried.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were beauties, though, bound in morocco,
with gilt edges and tuck covers; and the longer I
had them the more I was convinced there were
plenty of people hungering and thirsting for the
books, if I only knew who they were, and how to
reach them.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last I hit upon a plan. I always did hit a
plan if I took the time, and that was my weak
point. I was apt to waste many precious moments
in reflection which should have been used in
action.</p>

<p class='c012'>What I thought of was this:</p>

<p class='c012'>Through the aid of several different city directories
I secured the names of hundreds of saloon-keepers.
As a class—outside of their own business,
which I do not at all revere—they are a
jolly, happy-go-lucky lot of people, who admire
what has the appearance of a practical joke, are
free with their money, and are on the best of
terms with all the world and the rest of mankind.</p>

<p class='c012'>I wrapped each book in a neat and separate
package, and distributed the whole lot so that the
three hundred and eighty volumes would reach
three hundred and eighty different saloon-keepers
on Christmas day, each one priced “One dollar,
C. O. D.”</p>

<p class='c012'>One day ahead I sent out to each individual I
had marked as my own a letter like the following:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear Brother:—The good book hath said,
‘There is a time for everything,’ and there is a
time to turn from earthly joys and earthly gains
and think of those mansions in the skies which
one day will be our lot if we only redeem the accepted
time. It has well been said, ‘Prepare thy
souls for the Resurrection day and the judgment,’
To do this you must read the good book, else you
cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I send you today by express a nice pocket edition
of the bible. If you think it may save your
soul, take it and pay the charges. If you have no
confidence in the holy book do not receive it. In
any case, God bless you. From</p>
<p class='c022'>“<span class='sc'>A Friend</span>.”</p>

<p class='c021'>About one-third of the bibles were accepted on
the first delivery. I took my money, which was
more than half profit, and magnanimously presented
the express company with the remaining
unclaimed packages, suspecting that every one of
them would be a dead loss to me.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Portrait Business—Tricks of the
Trade—The Band and Hall Plan—Excitement
and Joke at Voting Contest—The
Frame Scheme.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>The season came when I was to go on the road
again. The winter had been one largely of rest
and study, during which I had practiced my vocation
enough to make a little money and keep my
hand in. Added to the capital acquired in the latter
part of the previous summer’s campaign, I
was ready to take up almost any line of work.</p>

<p class='c012'>I confess I had a yearning for something new;
something that would lead me along the quieter
walks of life, and be less wearing on nerves and
throat than the street selling of the former season.
After looking around, and making a list of
dealers and their stock, which might be useful in
the future, I decided that for the present I would
turn my attention to the picture or portrait business.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a comparatively new thing then, and
even now it has not been entirely worked to death.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was then a fair profit in pictures or portraits,
and by the time one sold a high-priced
frame the outcome was immense. I got my instructions,
and when I first started out was half
inclined to believe that the trade would prove too
humdrum, a too every-day sort of an affair, to
suit my hustling nature.</p>

<p class='c012'>I soon found, however, that it took as lively
working as anything I had been engaged in if I
wanted to make it a success; hence, I fell to in
earnest, determined that a success it should be.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not worth while to relate all the little, ingenious
dodges employed, or the extraordinary
efforts I made upon emergency. I remembered
the maxim, that what made a good argument for
one line would do for another, and so, altering it
to suit the article and the circumstances, I drew
largely on the fund of expedients gathered in
other fields, and worked on human nature in the
same old way. I soon got to be very successful,
and when once I decided there was a chance to
place a picture I seldom gave up until I had succeeded.</p>

<p class='c012'>I never was ashamed of my business, and generally
managed to have my presence in a town
pretty well advertised. When I had been there a
couple of days, and went swinging down the
street, there were few if any of the citizens who
saw me but would know I was the picture man,
who was taking orders for enlarged portraits and
the like, and plenty of them would have some remark
to that effect. I carried a fine line of samples,
was a pleasant, fluent talker, and I fairly believe
many a lady would have been disappointed
if I had not called on her with my wares. Sometimes
I took orders direct for frames to the pictures;
sometimes I waited and delivered the picture
placed in a frame, trusting to be able to sell
the latter at a good price. If a town at large did
not turn out the average profit, then a single individual
or so would have to bear the sins of omission
of the rest.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are more tricks in the picture business
than one would imagine. I know of one fakir
who works the following scheme: After staying
in the town long enough to make a study of the
inhabitants and the peculiarities and foibles of the
more prominent, he selects his victim.</p>

<p class='c012'>He calls on some lady leading in social circles,
church work or the like, and obtains a private interview.</p>

<p class='c012'>He tells her that a number of her lady friends
and admirers have decided to present her with a
fine, enlarged, crayon portrait of herself, and that
he has been instructed to call and get her photograph.</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally, she is surprised and highly gratified,
giving him the picture without the least hesitancy.
At the same time she is probably anxious to learn
the names of the donors.</p>

<p class='c012'>The fakir tells her that that is a profound secret,
and that he is sworn to reveal no names,
though he has no hesitation in giving her the cost
of the picture. That is to be twenty-five dollars.
Then he starts for the door, but turns around to
say, “Oh, by the way, they said nothing about a
frame. Don’t you want to buy one? A picture
of that kind never produces one-half the effect
without a frame, and of course we can give you a
better quality at a cheaper rate than you can get
from your local dealers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes she would say, “I do not think I
will buy until I get the picture.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the fakir proceeds to tell her that his reputation
is staked on that picture, and that if it is
satisfactory he will obtain a dozen orders for the
ten-dollar size; and that he could not think of delivering
such a work of art without a properly
matched and corresponding frame.</p>

<p class='c012'>The lady is already in a good state of mind,
being elated over the idea of receiving such an
elegant present, and is not at all inclined to
quibble on the matter of expense; the fakir is argumentative,
eloquent and persuasive. She falls
his victim. In a few days the portrait is delivered,
grandly framed, and the flattered lady hands out
her share, never suspecting that the cost of the
frame well covered the price of it and the picture.</p>

<p class='c012'>That is one way to make the business pay, and
if the lady is too innocent to find out the deception,
her portrait can be made a stepping-stone for
a dozen other orders, just as was suggested to her.
After all, people are a good deal like sheep—a
whole flock will follow where one leads, however
unwittingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>The fact is, I would have been willing to give
away the portrait every time if I could have obtained
full price for the frame, had it not been
contrary to business principles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes, after securing a number of orders,
some of them would be turned back to me. The
party might die, or go broke, or something else
happen, and I usually had some dead wood on my
hands about the time I was almost ready to leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>That gave me little trouble. The frames were
very fine, of six-inch, heavy moulding, beautifully
fluted and with gilt or oxidized trimmings.
So far as looks went, they were worth all you
might ask for them, if you left out of account the
actual cost of manufacture. I would walk into a
man’s place of business and set the frame against
something so the light could shine full upon it.
Then I would ask:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you think of that for six dollars?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“It’s pretty nice, but don’t try to
sell me any today; I haven’t the money.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Who said I wanted to sell them? I
am giving them away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“How is that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I’ll tell you. I am in the picture business,
and only furnish frames as an accommodation.
I had some thirteen orders turned back on
me, and I want to get rid of the frames. Freight
is double first-class, and it don’t pay to ship them
back. Besides, I haven’t the time to fool with
them, and I’m going to close them out regardless.
I’ll tell you what I’ll do. If I can get thirteen
orders in this town I’ll deliver them, just like this,
all complete and ready to frame your picture in,
for one dollar apiece. And I’ll bet one hundred
dollars you never saw a frame of that kind sold
under seven dollars.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer (examining the frame and getting
interested).—“Well, I must say, that is pretty
cheap.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Cheap? Why, it is virtually giving
them away, but I want to get rid of them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“You go ahead and see what
you can do with some one else. In the meantime
I’ll see my wife and find out what she thinks about
it. You can drop in after dinner for my answer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“See here, my friend, don’t make so
much fuss over a small sum. Your wife would
be ashamed to object to it. Would you kick if
she invested such a little amount as that at home?
Of course, you wouldn’t. You’re not that kind.
If your wife don’t say it’s right up-to-date and altogether
lovely I’ll let her have it for nothing.
What more do you want?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“Well, I don’t know. Have you
sold any of them yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent—“Oh, yes; I’ve taken several orders
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer—“Well, I guess you can put me
down for two frames. You agents are worse than
fly paper. You stick a man every time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent—“Ha, ha. Do you think so? If I have
the luck today that I expect I’ll deliver those
frames bright and early tomorrow morning.
Good-day, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At which point I would back myself out as
gracefully as I could and go in search of another
customer. Perhaps, before I was out of the door,
he would stop me to talk picture, and eventually
insist on my enlarging photographs for himself
and wife to fill the purchases.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was doing well, and making plenty of money,
but I wanted to do better.</p>

<p class='c012'>I might have had a presentment of my fate
when I launched out, from the fact that I had already
noticed a peculiarity about my fortunes.
While I could do well by myself, or could work
well in company so long as the other fellow ostensibly
managed the concern, yet when I attempted
to play manager over other people I always went
broke, or the aggregation dissolved with breathless
suddenness.</p>

<p class='c012'>I thought of this before I branched out in the
picture business after the fashion I did, but the
idea I had seemed such a good one, and I was already
so largely a winner, I shut my eyes, locked
my teeth hard, and vowed I would break the
hoodoo that seemed to be over me, or know the
reason why.</p>

<p class='c012'>Later on I discovered the reason in this particular
case, and the knowledge only came just in
time to save me from again landing in the ranks
of the busted. The brief history of the experiment
was about this:</p>

<p class='c012'>After trying the old style of canvassing, that
is, personally taking orders from door to door
and returning at a future day to make deliveries
and collections, I struck on one of the most elaborate
schemes for working the portrait business
that had ever been introduced.</p>

<p class='c012'>The idea was probably suggested by my meeting,
as I had done more than once before, with a
party of stranded people of the theatrical profession.
In the summer-time you are apt to run
across the very best kind of people who are out of
an engagement, or who may have been left behind
by an absconding manager of a “snap” company,
which they had joined in default of anything better
to do until the regular fall season opened.</p>

<p class='c012'>After thinking the matter over for a day or
two, and arranging my plans, I formed a company
consisting of eight people, all of them musicians
and actors. I got some printing done, and
ordered more, and started out on the road to work
my business in opera houses or large halls. I had
with me, also, a superior artist.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the day, by way of advertising, the
band would give open air concerts, at times when
they were not otherwise engaged, and in the evening
there was a grand, free entertainment in the
opera house. Between the acts I made a talk from
the stage, exhibited specimens of work by the aid
of the “oxo-hydrogen lime light,” and solicited
business. I took the orders, finished the pictures,
delivered and collected, all before leaving the city.
I paid the expenses of my troupe and had them
canvass during the day, paying them an additional
ten per cent. upon all the orders they secured.
It was immense.</p>

<p class='c012'>Up to about this time the large, framed portrait
was a rarity, and in every vicinity there were
hundreds of people with small pictures of their
relatives or themselves, which, with the proper
working, they discovered they wanted to possess
in an enlarged form.</p>

<p class='c012'>In those towns or cities which I visited (and, of
course, with such an aggregation to support, I
selected only the larger towns), I made my business
quite the fashionable folly or fad, and many
a ten dollars was, no doubt, expended just to keep
in with the swim. I heightened the interest in
half a dozen ways, and for a time certainly met
with all the success I had anticipated.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes I came to the rescue of a struggling
congregation, which wanted to buy a new organ,
or square up the preacher’s salary, or raise money
for some other purpose. I remember, at Haddam
City, I raffled off two large oil paintings, advertised
as worth two hundred and fifty dollars. I
had used them as drawing cards, placing side by
side with them reduced copies, to show the possibilities
of our art. On starting the raffle I made
the most glowing announcement from the stage.
I explained that I had found these works of art
too bulky to carry with me from town to town.
They were so valuable that it required more care
to protect them from injury than we could afford
to give.</p>

<p class='c012'>I proposed that during my stay in the town I
would give to each patron a number for every dollar
invested, entitling him or her to a chance in a
drawing for one of the pictures, which I intended
to make on the last night. The other picture I
then offered as a prize for a voting contest for the
most popular young lady in the city, the proceeds
to go to the benefit of the church.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before making this offer, I had looked over the
ground very carefully, and was certain it would
yield a success. I found I had not been mistaken.
The pictures were really fine ones, costing me
fifty dollars at wholesale, but by using them in
this way I believe they netted me more than their
cost.</p>

<p class='c012'>The voting contest developed a rivalry I had
not anticipated, and not only were the audiences
immense, but the dimes rolled by the dozen into
the hands of the two young gentlemen that were
appointed treasurers of the church.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our own interests were not forgotten. They
seemed about that time to be tangled up with
those of the church, and the way we gathered
orders, both at the entertainments and in the outside
canvass, kept my artist working night and
day, and very nearly strained my ability.</p>

<p class='c012'>In anticipation of the step, I had headed my
troupe on the second evening of our stay in the
place, which happened to be Sunday, and we all
filed into church together. Our exhibitions,
while lively and interesting, were all of the most
unobjectionable order, and in every way I worked
it so that we would seem, as we were, worthy of
the support of the best people.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the outset it seemed a foregone conclusion
that a Miss Kitty Kneilson would carry away the
palm. She was so far ahead at the close of the
second evening of voting that I was afraid interest
might slacken and the receipts fall off. The
next evening there happened, altogether by
chance, something I would never have thought of,
and if I had would scarcely have dared to suggest.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some innocent, scatter-brained, harum-scarum
young fellow dropped a vote in the box inscribed
with the name of “Claude Maxwell.” When that
name was read out there was a roar through the
house, and I was afraid there was going to be
trouble. Claude Maxwell was a very estimable
young gentleman, but he belonged to that class
who from their fair appearance, exact dress, and
mincing manners are sometimes called dudes. He
was bright, big-hearted and full of life, but every
one recognized the joke, and there was a clapping
of hands, and much laughter, before it was
thought how Maxwell might take it.</p>

<p class='c012'>All doubt on that score was removed by the
young gentleman himself, who arose in the seat,
somewhere near the front, a smile on his features,
and made a profound bow.</p>

<p class='c012'>With that the game was started. Maxwell had
any quantity of friends among the young folks,
and they all seemed seized with a sudden desire to
“josh” him. The next moment the tellers announced
“Ten more votes for Claude Maxwell.”
Some one had thrown in a dollar to keep the joke
going.</p>

<p class='c012'>I understood that Miss Kneilson was the more
affronted of the two; but as she belonged to the
church, and both she and Maxwell were members
of the choir, her friends convinced her that nothing
better could have happened. Before long she
was enjoying the contest as much as anybody.</p>

<p class='c012'>You cannot imagine the interest and the amount
of money that can be drawn into such an affair at
times, when the contest grows close and the people
are excited. When the musicians played the
Marseillaise on the last night there were a few
hundred folks worked up to a fever heat, and had
it not been announced beforehand that the voting
would cease precisely at ten o’clock I have an idea
that fifty dollars more might have been taken in
that evening. The polls closed precisely on the
stroke, and just a moment before a five-dollar bill
was slipped in, which secured the picture for
Claude Maxwell by a majority of five.</p>

<p class='c012'>Amid much laughter and cheering Mr. Maxwell
arose to his feet and bowed his smiling
thanks to the audience.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not at all abashed by the screams of the audience
the young man proceeded to say that while,
for the good of the church in which he and the
other contestants were so deeply interested, he
had been willing for the matter to proceed, yet he
had never for a moment actually contemplated appropriating
the prize to himself. He therefore
took great pleasure in presenting the beautiful
work of art to the real choice of the assemblage,
Miss Kitty Kneilson.</p>

<p class='c012'>He sat down amidst thunders of applause.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had to remain three or four days to complete
the orders we had taken, and the treasury of the
church was filled to overflowing.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Tricks in Delivering and Collecting—The
Stingy Landlord and the Prunes—Day
Board $3.00 Per Week—Drummers $2.00 Per
Day—The Elopement.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>In the previous chapters I have said something
about orders that were turned back on my hands,
and the methods I employed to make at least some
profit out of my failures. I want to say a little
more on the subject, referring principally to delivering
and collecting. My remarks will apply
not only to the picture and frame business, but
also to the book and encyclopedia lines, in which
I was subsequently largely and successfully engaged.</p>

<p class='c012'>A good talker, with a fair knowledge of his
subject, can generally make sales, but his work
does not end there. He has not only to make a
contract, but he has to see that it is executed.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is but one way to do anything in this
world, and that is the right way.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I first started out by myself to take orders
for pictures, I had in mind the fact that I
was also to do my own delivering and collecting.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to the canvass, I was as suave as you please,
but in making deliveries I had to act according to
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c012'>In taking orders I always gave the customer a
duplicate slip of his contract. This, among other
conditions, stated that articles were to be delivered
according to agreement with the agent, who
had positive instructions to make no misrepresentations,
and that a countermand would not be
received under any circumstances; that any failure
to deliver would be charged up against me.</p>

<p class='c012'>You see, this duplicate was a great ice breaker
when I called around with my pictures or books
and expected the money.</p>

<p class='c012'>Occasionally I ran across an individual who
would try to back out. In such a case I would insist
on leaving the article anyway, and would say,
“Oh, that’s all right. If you can’t conveniently
spare the money now I will call around and see
you again before I leave town. You can pay me
then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Without waiting for an answer I would turn
on my heel and walk rapidly away.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next day I would call again. If the money
was still slow to come I would say, “I will call tomorrow
morning and I wish you would please
have the amount ready for me then. I want to
leave by an afternoon train.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If I called the third time and found no money
I would rise in my wrath—real or pretended as
the case might be—and call his attention to every
clause in the duplicate contract he held. If that
would not win him over I would wind up with a
tongue lashing and perhaps threaten to have him
arrested.</p>

<p class='c012'>I most generally brought an unwilling customer
to time by the third visit, though, of course,
there were cases in which no plan would win.
Sometimes I would succeed by arousing sympathy,
where no other method would have been
of any effect. I would argue that a man had no
right to order an article, and put one to a great
expense and loss of time, unless he expected to
accept and pay for it when delivered.</p>

<p class='c012'>In traveling with the troupe I found far less
trouble in making deliveries and collections than
I had done when by myself. The whole business
was such a public affair, and delivery and collection
followed so soon after the order was given,
that few thought of refusal. A large proportion
of the orders were secured in the public hall, the
rest being obtained in canvasses made by members
of the troupe during the day time. They
were also supposed to do their own delivering
and collecting, though I was often called in to attend
to difficult or delicate cases.</p>

<p class='c012'>By the way, to show you that the life of a fakir
is not all devoted to business, but that it has also
its romantic side, I may as well introduce a little
occurrence which happened under my observation
during the season that my company was on the
road.</p>

<p class='c012'>Business, as I have said, was driving and I had
procured a young man by the name of Thompson
to assist the artist in finishing up pictures. He
was really a fine young fellow, and his father had
a large photograph gallery of his own, in which
Aleck would have continued to work had he so
chosen. But he took a notion to see something of
the world, and so came out to me, where he could
knock around a bit and at the same time draw
good wages for a fair amount of labor.</p>

<p class='c012'>As a rule I stopped at pretty good hotels,
where, however, I generally secured fair rates.
Shortly after Aleck joined me we were in a town
where we had to accept a lodging place that was
far from satisfactory. The house was tolerable,
considering, and I had obtained pretty good
terms, but the landlord was one of those extremely
stingy, miserly fellows that are repulsive
to everybody and gives one a pain to be thrown
with. He was so stingy it even seemed to hurt
him to give change. I honestly believe he was
the original introducer of the fad of using a wart
on the back of his neck for a collar button. He
kept one of those characteristic hotels so familiar
to all traveling men, and in the office there hung a
sign something like this:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Single Meals, 20 Cents.</div>
    <div>Day Board, $3.00 Per Week.</div>
    <div>Drummers, $2.00 Per Day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The landlord was not only mean and miserly,
but he was given to the use of strong drink. It
was told as an actual fact that in one of his
drunken fits he walked out of his room, leaving
his latch key on the table. The door locked behind
him and when he was ready to return he
climbed over the door, through the transom, and
secured the key. He then crawled back into the
hall, through the same hole, unlocked the door
and staggered in.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some of his transient guests once played a
good joke on him, which gave him a great deal of
free advertising.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that hotel prunes were served as a dessert
three times a day and thirty days in the month.
A crowd of traveling men were sitting at the dinner
table, discussing various topics, when the
landlord walked in. One of the knights of the
grip called to him:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say, landlord, we have made a wager here,
and you are the only man who can settle it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” said mine host.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” responded the traveling man, “I bet a
new hat that this dish of prunes is the same mess
that was on the table when I was here a month
ago”</p>

<p class='c012'>The landlord replied hotly that it was not the
same; that he served fresh prunes at every meal.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hold on,” interrupted the drummer; “now
that I come to think of it I can decide that bet myself.
When I was here before I dropped a half
dollar in the dish.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that he picked up a spoon, drove it into
the prunes, and fished out the fifty-cent piece he
had secretly dropped in a few minutes before.</p>

<p class='c012'>The old man, amazed, glared at those prunes
for a moment and, growing red in the face with
rage, picked up the dish, went out to the kitchen
and cussed the cook for a week.</p>

<p class='c012'>This landlord was a widower and had a very
handsome daughter, whom he treated shamefully.
He forced her to work early and late, wait on the
table, do chamber work, help in the laundry, etc.
He would not allow her to wear anything better
than a common gingham dress, nor could she go
anywhere nor get acquainted with anybody. She
wanted an enlarged picture of her dead mother,
and when she asked her father for permission to
order it, instead of consenting he slapped her in
the face. All this in the presence of Aleck, who
happened to be there at the time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Aleck immediately left the house, but when he
returned the next day it was to present the girl
with a large crayon portrait of her mother, the
picture being enclosed in a handsome frame.</p>

<p class='c012'>The two met in the parlor every evening after
that, the old man being apparently oblivious of
what was going on, and the upshot of it all was
that on the following Sunday night they eloped
to a neighboring town and were married. Aleck
went back to his father’s gallery, and is there today
with his wife.</p>

<p class='c012'>The old landlord did not try to make trouble
for them, but turned all his wrath on me. He
swore I was to blame for the whole thing, threatened
to shoot me, to have me arrested, and everything
else.</p>

<p class='c012'>I denied, point blank, having had anything to
do with the affair; but I do not mind now acknowledging
that Aleck did consult me, that I
advised him to make the run, and loaned him an
extra twenty dollars to get away with.</p>

<p class='c014'>Things went along apparently prosperous for
some months, until the time to form engagements
for the fall and winter came around, when
my best people asked for a raise in salary.</p>

<p class='c012'>At first I was inclined to grant it, for I liked
the business, and, on the face of things, I ought
to make a fortune.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the briefest reflection told me that I would
be entering on a new campaign, and like a wise
and noble general I ought to sit down and figure
out the cost.</p>

<p class='c012'>After that, though it took time, it was not hard
to come to a conclusion. I had been doing a
thriving business, but I had the field all to myself,
with very little opposition from regular exhibitions.
The season was coming when the people
in the towns which I would care to work
might have a surfeit of amusement.</p>

<p class='c012'>I discovered, also, that if my receipts had been
large, so also had been my expenditures. I went
on, figured out the profit, cost and loss and decided
to quit right then.</p>

<p class='c012'>While apparently doing a business that should
have yielded a large surplus, my expenses were
already so great that I was actually making less
money than when traveling alone, while a few
weeks of poor business, such as were liable at any
moment to occur, would put me decidedly in the
hole. I paid off all salaries to the end of the
month, closed up my affairs, disbanded my company,
and once more hit the road, solitary and
alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>After all the noise and rush of the past
months, the first few weeks which followed were
solemn, if not awful; but I stuck it out, found
that the portrait line was as good as ever, and
what I made was my own. I could visit towns
which had been too small to stand the expense
of the troupe, but were full to the brim of untouched
business, which I worked after the same
old style.</p>

<p class='c012'>When a great battle is won by shrewd maneuvering
they call it a splendid display of strategy;
when a fakir carries his point in the same way it
is branded as infernal trickery. Early in the battle
of life I discovered that I would have to do a
great deal of strategical maneuvering or starve;
and I seldom failed, however well defended his
front might be, to turn the flank of the enemy if it
was at all unprotected, often snatching victory
out of the very jaws of defeat.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once, under peculiar provocation, I obtained
an order from a saloon keeper for a nice crayon
portrait of his wife. I had great hopes of getting
an order for his own portrait also, and with that
end in view, and being naturally of a generous
disposition when I circulated among the boys, I
spent about five dollars at the bar. When he
turned me down in what I thought rather a bare-faced
style, I set about getting even.</p>

<p class='c012'>His wife was a pronounced brunette, with
black, curly hair, bright eyes and clear-cut features,
being an excellent subject for a portrait.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the picture was finished it was really a
very fine one, and taking it around to the saloon
a day or two before I had promised delivery I
asked his honor what he thought of it. He admired
it immensely and was more than pleased.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” said I, “it may be a surprise, but this
picture is not for you. The one you ordered is
not finished yet, and this is done by a new process
and for a particular purpose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If that is not for me I’d like to know who it
is for?” he asked, about as angry as he was surprised.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For me,” I told him. “It is such a perfect
picture, and such a splendid example of what the
new art will do, and what a magnificent picture
can be obtained for only ten dollars more, that the
house has sent it to me to canvass with.”</p>

<p class='c012'>You can believe that he got dead stuck on the
picture and wanted it instead of the other. I
asked him an increase of ten dollars for it, but
compromised by accepting from him five dollars
more than the original contract price. He never
knew the difference, and I got back the money I
had spent at his saloon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Things went along swimmingly for some time.
So successful had I been that I was feeling my
oats all over, and expected to go right along
through the winter, when I ran foul of a legal
proposition, and learned the lesson that it takes
money to buy justice; and though the law may
be on your side it sometimes requires an awfully
long time to reach it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every man who has traveled on the road has
probably had more or less trouble about license;
and the time arrived when I was to get my experience.
I was arrested while soliciting in the
portrait business, and was fined fifty dollars in a
city court.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was always rather a good fighter, anyway. I
had what I thought at that time plenty of money,
and my business life seemed to be at stake. Instead
of paying that fine and letting the matter
drop I took an appeal and vowed to follow the
matter up. When, finally, the state supreme court
affirmed the decision of the city court, and I still
refused to pay, I found myself tight in jail, with
a suspicion that I had to knuckle or remain there
indefinitely.</p>

<p class='c012'>I still had money to talk, and, as the frames
were made in one state, I was traveling in a second,
and was a resident of a third, there was little
trouble in getting the case before the supreme
court of the United States, though it did seem to
me it took a terrible long time for that court to
come to a decision on a very simple case.</p>

<p class='c012'>When their opinion did come, however, it was
in my favor, and reversed all the lower courts.</p>

<p class='c012'>The justices held, in effect, that a man could
not be taxed for simply making a living; that
the license demanded from me had been an attempted
piece of extortion, which was an usurpation
of power for the officers to have sought to
collect, when it was their duty to see that law and
justice were secured to all.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was further held that no state nor city could
levy a tax on interstate commerce, in any form or
guise, or on receipts derived from that transportation,
or on the occupation or business of
carrying it on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, this was a great victory for me—when
it came—but it did not prevent me having
some very uncomfortable months and a course of
treatment which might have meant ruin to some.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps they mistook their man. Certainly
the authorities only considered me as a thief and
a vagabond from the very start, and were determined
to show me that a fakir had no rights
which they were bound to respect. I was arrested
in the very harshest manner, and though a couple
of citizens temporarily signed as my security,
it was not long before I found
myself in jail, where on entering I
was stripped of my diamonds and all the
loose money I had in my pockets, which last
was quite a little sum. They appeared to want
to make sure of the fifty dollars fine and costs,
and if possible to prevent my having any money
with which to fight the city in the courts and to
make my stay in that jail as uncomfortable as
possible. My treatment there was simply vile,
and when I took a severe cold in an infernally bad
cell, and through lack of attention the cold drifted
into pneumonia, I began to believe there was a
conspiracy to murder me. I think I would have
died had it not been for some good ladies, who at
that very moment were being sneered at for attempting
to inaugurate practical Christianity by
visiting those who were sick and in prison. They
managed to see that I was nursed through to
semi-convalescence, and made an effort to have
my fine remitted and a discharge granted. The
county attorney appeared against them, however,
and as they were represented by a young man of
more goodness than knowledge of law or eloquence
their prayer was denied.</p>

<p class='c012'>Feeling sure, then, that the city would remain
obdurate, and that to remain longer in prison
would mean death, I paid fine and costs under
protest and crawled out to the free sunlight once
more, “busted” in health and pocket, and only
too glad to get out.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the end, as I have told, I procured a decision
of the United States court in my favor, and
then my counsel came back on the city for damages,
eventually settling with the authorities for
a nice little sum. Long before that, however, I
had largely recovered my health and spirits and
was once more on the high road to prosperity.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I came out of prison I was in no condition,
financially, to long remain idle, for I had no
idea of asking or receiving assistance from the
folks at home. Nor was I in condition physically
to do the exhaustive hustling I had been following
for some years. I had to take up with something
easy, and as I had no capital to speak of
there was no time to pick and choose. I took up
with the first thing which offered employment,
and considered myself lucky that as a stranger in
a strange place I was able to secure a position as
solicitor for an insurance scheme, which was certainly
as big a fake as any I had ever met with.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “company” had been organized long
enough to inspire some confidence and was doing
a thriving business on the following scheme,
which was just a variation of what has been called
the “graveyard” plan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Any man could pay in by installments within
ninety days the sum of thirty dollars and have his
life insured for one hundred, while on the day
after the last payment he could draw out sixty
dollars in cash, always provided he fulfilled faithfully
certain conditions, the most important of
which was that within thirty days he was to furnish
two new members. Of course, the two new
members had to do the same thing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some persons might think a fake like that
could not win, but it did. Men with plausible
tongues can start almost anything, and once get
a scheme like this to going it soon grows into a
regular epidemic. Where it would have ended I
cannot say, had not the state insurance commissioner
interfered, to the great disgust of the
policy holders, who were willing and anxious
each to put up the remainder of his thirty dollars
in order that sixty might be drawn. The company
made no great fight for life. It had been
making big money while it lasted, paid its agents
well, and dissolved with full pockets, leaving me
improved in health, capital and general knowledge
of what the world wanted and was willing
to pay for.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the insurance scheme gave out I jumped
the town, because I knew the law was going to
step in, and I had enjoyed my fill of legal entanglements
and didn’t want any more. With what
money I had I went down the road about twenty
miles to a little station called B——. The first
thing I did was to put up at the only hotel there
was in town. I asked the landlord what his rates
were. He took me into the dining room and
showed me two tables; one was covered with
white cloth and the other with Turkey red. Pointing
to the white he said, “If you eat at this table
it will cost you two dollars a day and you get cake
every meal, but if you eat over there with the
boarders it will cost you three dollars per week,
but you don’t git no cake.” I played the red for a
week and came out all right; but, oh, such a hotel.
It was while here looking for some light outdoor
work that I fell in with a traveling horse
doctor. He had a scheme of his own and was
working it to the queen’s taste. I suspect that I
knew more about horses than that doctor, but
that is neither here nor there. He claimed to
have a sure cure for hog cholera. I told him my
predicament and he took me along.</p>

<p class='c012'>His plan of treatment was to catch a hog, give
him a hypodermic injection close to the tail and
then turn him loose. Charges were ten cents per
head.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was cholera all around the neighborhood
and for about four months we did a nice
business. One day, though, a large drove of hogs
we had just operated on suddenly took sick and
died. The doctor heard of it in time and skipped.
So did I, and we went in different directions. The
last thing he did before we parted was to hand me
three ten-dollar bills, and I was on earth once
more.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here I was, adrift again, with a little money,
but my health not at all restored and my case before
the supreme court of the United States still
hanging fire. I looked around for some light,
open-air business and invested in a wheel of fortune,
some cigars and a license to run the thing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably the reader is familiar with the instrument,
though it is not so much in evidence now, I
believe, as it was in those days. The anti-gambling
laws of many of the states have made it a
less profitable investment.</p>

<p class='c012'>This wheel had six rows of numbers, from one
to five, encircling it. I charged five cents a turn
and guaranteed a prize every time. For number
one I gave one cigar, for number two two cigars,
and so on up to number five.</p>

<p class='c012'>Even if a man would win five cigars, which did
not occur often, I was not dangerously hurt, as
I bought my stock low down, the average profits
on the thousand being an enormous per cent.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was not “big money” in the wheel, but
for a small venture the returns were pretty fair,
and with it as a companion I wandered over a
wide range of country, recovering my health, seeing
the world and gaining more experience. A little
adventure in the west will give you an idea of
the sort of thing I was apt to meet with.</p>

<p class='c012'>I took the stage for the small town of Gurnsville,
and when I arrived all was excitement on
account of a wagon circus which was showing
there. I had not struck the show before, but imagined
I was going to turn a pretty penny off the
crowd which would be in attendance.</p>

<p class='c012'>To my disgust I found the authorities were not
going to allow anything that even looked like
gambling. Circuses have an unholy reputation
for fleecing the public with all sorts of catch
games, and the city had resolved that the innocents
should be protected, and reserved for the
faro banks and keno tables of the town, of which
I understood there were more than a sufficient
supply usually in full blast. I could not get a license
to run my wheel of fortune with cigars.</p>

<p class='c012'>In those days the majority of the citizens of
Gurnsville, if they smoked, used pipes. A cigar
was considered to be the mark of a dead-game
sport, for the cheapest thing you could get was
fifteen cents, or two for a quarter. The storekeepers
and merchants had pooled their issues to
a certain extent and united in a sort of trust to
keep up prices. Wages were high, so they could
ask big prices, not only for cigars, but for everything
else.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had about three thousand cigars with me and
did not want to lose the day, so I took out a license
to sell on the street in the ordinary manner.
About this time I was more particular about the
license than before or since. I rented a small
glass case and opened a stand right near the show
grounds.</p>

<p class='c012'>I assorted the cigars, putting the light colored
ones on one side and the dark on the other. The
medium shade I also separated. The light ones
I sold two for five cents, the dark ones five cents
each, and the medium ones for ten and fifteen
cents. They were all of the same quality and cost
the same price, being as low an article as I could
find that had a half-way decent outside.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the crowds began to gather about the
tents, long before the hour for opening the doors,
I yelled at the top of my voice, “Right this way.
Two fine cigars for five cents.”</p>

<p class='c012'>People there had never paid less than fifteen
cents for one cigar, and the idea of getting two
for a nickel excited them. They fairly ran over
each other in getting to the case.</p>

<p class='c012'>If a straggling fellow would come up with his
“best gal” on his arm I would call his attention
to the better goods in the case. Of course, rather
than give his girl the impression he was close-fisted,
and bought cheap cigars, he would flip me
a twenty-five-cent piece and take two for a quarter.
I sold out those three thousand cigars slick
and clean, and was sorry I had not a few thousand
more. The result almost convinced me that
legitimate business beats gambling every time. I
went away with about three times as much money
as I could possibly have had had they allowed me
to run my little old wheel of fortune.</p>

<p class='c012'>That was doing pretty well, but see how pride
goes before a fall. Having sold out, and having
a pretty fair little sum of money in my pockets, I
decided to turn my face from the frontier and
seek a locality where I could get into something
which would more rapidly add to the small fortune
I had accumulated. I paid my fare and
traveled like a gentleman. The stage coach in
which I journeyed was held up by road agents
and I was robbed of every cent I had, except the
loose change in my pockets. In consideration of
my semi-clerical garb, I suppose, they made no
search of my person after I had handed out my
wallet. In that way I saved my ticket—which
included both stage and railway transportation to
my destination, which was a small city, where I
expected to do some business—and a few dollars
in silver.</p>

<p class='c012'>I may say here that I never saw my wheel of
fortune again. I had supposed it was stowed in
the boot of the stage, but when I got off it was
not there. The driver promised to start it for
Munro on the next stage out after he got back,
but it never reached me. It seems it was started
all right, though, but the stage went over the
rocks at a bad place in the road and both were
helplessly wrecked, while one of the horses was
killed on the spot. Fortunately, there were no
passengers.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I reached Munro on the train I met with
a little adventure. It so happened that a big revival
meeting was in progress at the place and an
outside minister was expected to arrive on my
train, who was to assist the local ministers with
the meeting.</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally, one of the members came to meet
the brother; and naturally, again, he took the
daily hack which regularly met the train, since it
was about a mile and a half from the station to
the town.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was the only passenger to get off, and as I
had a smooth-shaven face and wore a Prince Albert
coat the deacon supposed I was his man. He
rushed up, greeted me cordially, grasped my grip
and invited me into the hack.</p>

<p class='c012'>I, naturally thinking he was a hotel runner (in
these God-forsaken places everyone wears such a
forlorn and melancholy look that it is hard to distinguish
a preacher from a porter), followed
without resistance.</p>

<p class='c012'>We started off at a good gait, the way was
rough, and the driver in a hurry. We were the
only passengers and sat on the same seat, the
front one being occupied by my valise and various
packages which seemed to be in care of the driver.
Time after time, as the wheels struck a particularly
bad spot, my companion and I were jammed
together.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whenever this happened he would turn to me
with what seemed to be a surprised and aggrieved
frown on his face and say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look out, brother. Stop, stop.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally, after a particularly big lurch, he said
positively:</p>

<p class='c012'>“See here, now, I want you to quit.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As I was to blame no more than he for these
little, unpleasant accidents, I could not understand
his taking them so seriously, but I noticed
that he kept getting redder in the face and madder
the further we traveled.</p>

<p class='c012'>At first I took it for a local joke and tried to
laugh it off, but the more I laughed the madder
he grew.</p>

<p class='c012'>The hack was going at a rapid rate, and on
turning sharply an angle in the road we were
jammed into each other more savagely than ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>This time he jumped up as quick as a flash, his
eyes blazing with rage, and let forth such a torrent
of words that he cut large holes in the air.
Whew! He gave me the worst tongue-lashing I
ever got in my life, beating the oration of a
mother-in-law. Even she would not have used
the language he did, for it was scientifically applied
and too strong for ordinary use.</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time I began to smell a mouse, and,
taking things calmly, induced him to explain.
Then I made an investigation.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had in my pocket a file, which I used to regulate
my street torch. The point of it had worked
out, and every time we were jammed together he
would catch it in his side. The last time it caught
him stronger than ever, causing his extreme outburst.</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked from my face to the file, and then
from my face to the file again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, to my surprise, he suddenly covered his
face with his hands and burst into a flood of tears.
I have heard men cry, both before and since, but
never a strong man weep like he did.</p>

<p class='c012'>It did not turn me against him, but, on the contrary,
I tried to console him, and so his story
came out. He was a reformed man, who kept
violent passions under control only by the greatest
effort; and to him it seemed he had sinned
beyond pardon, and that there could be no hope
for him in the future.</p>

<p class='c012'>I told him that if a good man could not fall
we would have to pray not to be led into temptation,
and wound up with:</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear brother, God knows what has happened;
you know and I know. We three understand.
The rest of the world might not. Let us
keep it among ourselves, and decide that anything
of the kind shall not happen again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I think, perhaps, that little incident did us both
good, though the preacher was more than ever
abashed when he learned that I was not a brother
clerico, but a traveling—I never explained to him
what, for fear the lesson I had read him might be
thrown away.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ensuing weeks were possibly the most
varied and really the most eventful of my career.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no time to be choice. Being broke
and far away from headquarters, I was forced to
spread myself after any and every fashion that
presented itself; and I found that the most foolish
and harmless of fakes sometimes presented
very handsome returns.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bless your soul, I never was at fault. I filled
a nice lot of bottles with clear water, put in a
cent’s worth of flavoring extract, and sold it as
an electric face wash—price ten cents per bottle.
Used according to directions I haven’t a doubt it
did all that it was guaranteed to do. Clear water,
fresh air, a good conscience and a whole lot of
imagination “will do heaps.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I sold a renovating liquid, made from vinegar,
salt and ammonia, at twenty-five cents per bottle.</p>

<p class='c012'>A little receipt for mixing gold paint did fairly
well. At one time I sold candy as an anti-coal oil
explosive, getting five cents for three small pieces.
When you are in hard luck and away from home
it don’t pay to be too particular, and everything
was fish that came into my net. Handle coal oil
the way I told ‘em and there would never be any
explosion, anyway.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day while making my rounds with my
anti-explosives I dropped into a shoe shop and
found the cobbler to be a little, dried-up, sickly
old man, who was afflicted with some nervous
ailment which kept him from sleeping. In telling
me his tale of woe he mentioned the fact that he
had not slept any for three nights. I told him,
sympathizingly, that I was once troubled in the
same way, but was now entirely cured. I further
stated that I had a bottle of medicine, and if
he wanted it he could have it at just what it cost
me, as I had not needed it for several years.
Though he would not go to a doctor he was only
too glad to get from me something which
promised relief. I told him I would just slip
around to the hotel and get the bottle; and leaving
him went to a druggist, who put me up a
sleeping draught, for which he charged me
seventy cents. My friend, the cobbler, paid
me one dollar, and the next day delightfully told
me had just had the best night’s rest he had
known for years.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this way I went on, and it was on this trip
that I struck a town in a temperance, or “Maine
law,” state where the county fair was in progress.</p>

<p class='c012'>I bought a permit to sell temperance drinks on
the grounds, for I had found where I could buy a
lot of empty beer and whisky bottles. I had a
stall or pen for my use, and placing four wash-tubs
almost filled with ice in the darkest corner,
where they could scarcely be seen, I loaded my
bottles with good, strong, cold tea and packed
them on ice. In front I had a small stock of pop
and some real, red circus lemonade. There is a
fortune in the latter itself, if you can only sell
enough of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>In temperance towns, when you walk into a
drug store and call for “cold tea,” the clerk knows
what you mean and winks when he hands you the
liquor. When I began to yell, “Right this way,
gentlemen, for your cold tea; and here you have
your ice cold lemonade. Here you have your California
pop, and the coldest tea you ever tackled.”
The crowd flocked around, and I did a land office
business.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, as soon as a man tasted his tea he
tumbled to the racket; but as it was a good joke
he would smile to himself and not give it away.
If some unsuspecting stranger would walk up and
call for beer I would tell him, with a wink, “We
don’t keep beer nor whiskey, but I have some
lemonade and awfully nice ‘cold tea.’ He would
tumble, as he supposed, and take cold tea in his’n,
stick the bottle in his hip pocket, and walk off
with a smile on his face as big as a Kansas City
ham. I sold the beer bottles at twenty-five cents
each and the whiskey bottles (pints) at fifty. I
am afraid to say how much were my profits. You
can guess.</p>

<p class='c012'>Though I may seem to have been successful in
my schemes—and I was—yet they were small
ones, parts of the country I was in were poor, and
when I had worked around to a broader field I
was still short of capital, and undecided about
settling down on any particular line. I believe I
was at my lowest ebb for about a year, in which
I worked all sorts of things. I traveled as a renovator,
cleaning clothing, hats and garments when
I had to, but preferring to sell the liquid which
did the work. I gave away little packages of
medicine, and sold with them a book for twenty-five
cents, which was supposed to be a treatise on
the anatomy of man. At one time I was a professional
carpet cleaner, who guaranteed to clean
a carpet without pain and remove grease while
the customer waited. I used to clean a spot by
way of sample, and then sell the stuff to do the
rest. I had a furniture polish which was handled
on the same plan. I sold rugs by installments,
and was the originator of the scheme of selling
watches on the street, the price payable by installments.
I worked about three months at that,
going backward and forward to make my collections,
and finding it paid fairly well. Then there
was the cologne and perfumery fake. The articles
were done up in fancy packages, in which
was enclosed a circular. These were distributed
from door to door, and so well was the circular
worded that on calling the next day for the money
or package it was generally the money. The price
was seventy-five cents a package, or one dollar
and a quarter for two.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was the advertising directory scheme,
which could be handled without much danger of
failure if you could find a field which had not
been occupied. Every one wants a directory of
the city and county if it can be had at a reasonable
price, and advertisers will take space enough to
make good profit. There were plenty of things
for a bustling man to turn his attention to, and
as my health became re-established more firmly,
my head began to rise above water.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day I figured up my cash and found I had
more than one hundred dollars, and decided to
send for a stock of goods.</p>

<p class='c012'>I always was successful at street selling, and
though I made the bulk of my money in other
lines, at this particular time my preference lay in
that direction. There was something fascinating
in gathering a crowd; to change its cold, marble
stare into one of eager expectancy; to warm it
up to the highest pitch, and bring the coin rolling
in through the power of my own magnetic eloquence.</p>

<p class='c012'>You can make up your mind that, though some
men may be proof against your most seductive
wiles, the mass of them are not. Pack men closely
together, start up the battery of your personal
magnetism, and you will get somebody under
control. Then the fire will spread from him to
another, and so on, until the mass of the throng
are just as much your victims as though they had
resigned themselves to a hypnotic doctor on the
stage.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are dozens of ways in which a crowd can
be prepared for this influence and by which it can
be maintained. Take the pretended money deception.
That operates along this line. I used
to carry a lot of dummy stacks of coin money.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were put up to resemble piles of silver
dollars and five and ten and twenty-dollar gold
pieces, and looked like stacks of real money. To
all appearance I would have thousands and thousands
of dollars stacked up in front of me in the
carriage, and I found that its presence helped me
out wonderfully in holding and magnetizing a
crowd. They would stand around, gazing at this
money and wanting to see what I was going to do
with it, until they forgot all about it in their interest
in something else. But all the same I had
started their expectant attention, and by and by
they were ready to see the green cheese in the
moon. With such an evidence of wealth in sight
they were ready to believe in the value of almost
anything I presented.</p>

<p class='c012'>I also used an imitation of paper money with
the same effect.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I got fairly in the swing of “giving
away” goods I would say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t imagine, gentlemen, that I am traveling
simply for personal profit made now and at your
expense. I am introducing these goods. That’s
all there is to it. The firm I am with represents
millions, and I have all the money of my own that
I know what to do with. I don’t need yours. You
can see for yourselves my very clothes are lined
with it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then I would pull out bundles of this green
paper from every pocket, piling them on the table
in front of me, and perhaps seeming to light a
cigar with a ten or twenty-dollar bill.</p>

<p class='c012'>This particular time I sold jewelry packages
and after giving some kind of an interlude I
would say to the crowd:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, gentlemen, I have traveled over every
state and territory in this glorious union, and in
all foreign lands; I am known the world over as
whole-souled, honest, liberal Jim, the man who
gives goods away. I am going to show you tonight
that I deserve the title. You’ve done considerable
for me; I’m going to do something for
you.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here is a genuine, black kid purse with fourteen
rivets. It would cost you in the regular way
fifty-five cents. Here are a pair of patent lever
collar buttons, that should cost you at least half a
dollar. I’ll just drop them into the little pocket
book. Here I have a beautiful wedding ring,
warranted solid brass. You’ll notice I don’t
make misrepresentations. We’ll say that this
wedding ring is worth a nickel, and drop it also
into the purse, like this. Then, we’ll go right
down here and get a pair of these beautiful, agate
setting cuff buttons, that any jeweler in the world
would charge you a great big dollar for. We’ll
drop them into the little purse and call the whole
outfit two dollars. Don’t forget. They are a fortune
in themselves, magnetic and diretic, and can
be used internally, externally, eternally and ever-lastingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does any one want them for two dollars?</p>

<p class='c012'>“No? Well, I’ll tell you what more I’ll do.
I’ve only got about a dozen of these little outfits
and I am determined to get rid of them tonight.
I’ll do it, too, if I have to throw ‘em away. But,
hold on. I’ll see what I can find. Here is a little
diamond stud that I’d give a dollar for myself.
I’ll just drop that into the purse and call it three
dollars. Last, but not least, I’ll go right down
here and get one of these beautiful, elegant, genuine,
double-linked, aluminum chains, with a patent
bar and swivel on each end. If you can go to
any store in your city and get one for less than a
three-dollar bill I’ll make you a present of one
hundred dollars. I’ll just drop the chain into the
little purse here and call the outfit six dollars, altogether.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, gentlemen, don’t get scared or faint
away, but the first man who passes me up a quarter
gets the entire outfit, purse, magnetic agate,
studs, ring, collar buttons and chain. Only twenty-five
cents for the entire lot. Ah! There is
the man who takes it. Now, for another lot, and
then we’ll see if we can’t find something else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not more than a half bad scheme to
praise the town, telling how much you liked it,
and what noble, whole-souled, up-to-date, generous
business citizens they had. With all the evidences
of wealth in front of me, some such gag as
this always caught the heart of the crowd.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I tell you, gentlemen, you’ve got a grand
town here, a noble town. You can imagine that
I love it, because when I struck the place but a
week or two ago I was clean, dead-broke. That’s
a tough way for a fellow to be, but for a fact I
didn’t have a cent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And look at me now. I walked up to the St.
James hotel and registered. I told the proprietor,
Johnson—you all know him, square as a die
and as good a man as ever lived—what a predicament
I was in, and struck him for a job, stating,
too, that I was an old, experienced hotel man.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He said he would hire me, and put me to work
in the dining room as a waiter. Perhaps some of
you remember my first appearance there.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At dinner time the guests began crowding
around the table, and after taking about six
orders at once I picked up my tray and rushed
into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c012'>“On my way back I slipped on a banana peeling
and fell, with my whole load, to the floor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The landlord came running in, mad as a hornet,
and said: ‘Get out of this, quick as you can,
you blankety-blank fool; I’ve got enough of you.
I can’t have any of your confounded gambling in
this house.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“I got up and begged for a new trial, but he
was obstinate, and told me I ought to have better
sense than to gamble in the dining room before
all the guests.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Gambling?’ said I.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Yes, gambling,’ said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘how do you figure that out?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why,’ answered he, ‘you had a tray full and
you dropped your pile.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>As I always picked out a landlord who was
known to sometimes dally with the seductive
jackpot, and knew, too, the value of a bob-tail
flush, the story was sure to make a hit.</p>

<p class='c012'>I would then go on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ladies and gentlemen, if I was not afraid of
exciting your sympathies I would sing you a sentimental
song I have in my repertoire. It is so
mesmeric in its nature and electrical in its action
that I most generally like to leave it out, or until
the last thing, for fear I might be overpowered
like the rest of you. I sang it in Boonsville last
week and nothing was good enough for me; and
if they hadn’t needed them themselves I think
they would have even taken off the old shoes from
their feet to throw into the wagon. Silver? Silver
wasn’t in it. They just filled this carriage
with golden eggs, and they tossed me at least a
hundred bouquets, each one tied to a brick. The
title of this morceau is: ‘Biddy’s Got a Corn on
Her Nose.’</p>

<p class='c012'>As they always liked to laugh I kept the comic
stories going, even if they were old and common
property among the fakir fraternity. Perhaps I
would go on in this fashion:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I want to tell you of a little experience with
my wife, a month before we were married. I had
been calling on her for several years and she was
the chilliest, most icy proposition you ever heard
of. She never would let me kiss her. When I
finally proposed she said: ‘I’ll marry you on one
condition.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘What’s that?’ said I.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She replied that if I would run her a foot race
and catch her she would be mine. The only condition
she made was that I was to give her one
hundred yards the start.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, I accepted. We started. She ran
up one street and down the next, through alleys,
buildings, stairways and everything that came
along. Whew! But that girl was a runner.
When I reached one corner I would just get a
glimpse of her making the turn in the block
ahead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just as I was about to give up in despair I
saw her run into a big church.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Like a whirlwind I tore after her and found a
big revival meeting in progress. When I reached
the center of the middle aisle the preacher, who
was in the midst of the sermon, looked up and
shouted to me:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘What’s the matter, brother? Are you looking
for salvation?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘No,’ I yelled back, ‘I’m looking for Sal Skinner.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will now sing you another beautiful lyric,
most sentimental and touching, entitled, ‘’Tis
Only a Chunk of Kindling from My Sweetheart’s
Wooden Leg.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>I varied the purse scheme for disposing of jewelry
with a fake that was quite successful, seldom
made trouble, and which offered a fair amount of
money.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had got hold of a little toy watch that I
thought was really a bargain. It looked for the
world like a real one, and at wholesale it cost me
just seven cents. To each one I attached a chain
that cost eight cents and then placed them in
fancy, red lined paper boxes, all ready for offering
to the public.</p>

<p class='c012'>In addition to my own vocal and instrumental
performances I usually had the specialties of one
or two musical comedians to attract and hold the
crowd so that I could keep it with me during the
entire sale. You will notice in the argument that
I used I made my strong talk on the watch, but
sold the chain.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, gentlemen,” I would say, “before we
close our entertainment I wish to address you for
a few moments and explain still further why I am
here.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You might naturally presume that I was simply
a street fakir by profession, who was out here
for your money. But, my friends, such is not the
case. I am not traveling for money, nor my
health, nor am I traveling on my shape. If I was
I would have been soaped long before this.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, strange as it may seem, I am now spending
my time and wasting my lungs for the sole
purpose of giving goods away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going to give every man here tonight
who is so fortunate as to get one a nice, new
watch. Yes, actually give it to him, free of charge.
The watches are manufactured in Boston by one
of the most reliable concerns in that city, and in
order to introduce them to the public they have
hired me to advertise them in this manner, and
given me positive instructions not to charge a
cent for the watches.</p>

<p class='c012'>“These chronometers have, as you see, genuine
hunting cases. They are not a full jeweled watch,
but they are stem-winders and stem-set, with as
pretty a dial and second hand as any high-priced
watch on the market.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And while I think of it, I want to tell you a
little experience a man had in Tirbyville a short
time ago. I was on the streets there, working as
I am tonight. The gentleman I refer to was in
the crowd and I gave him one of these watches.
He traded it the next day for a horse, traded the
horse for a diamond stud, traded the diamond
stud for a very valuable town lot, traded the lot
for a farm, struck oil on his farm, and then sold
out for sixty thousand dollars. What do you
think of that for a speculation? If you don’t
think that’s a lie I’ll tell you another one.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But this isn’t giving away watches, is it?
Now, I am going to surprise you still further by
putting a chain with each watch. You see, gentlemen,
I am one of the most liberal men you ever
saw; and you’ll think so, too, before I get through
here tonight. I just want to explain a little about
these chains and then I will hand the goods out to
you.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Several years ago a prominent mining expert
was prospecting in the Asiatic mines. While
hunting through the hills one day he ran across a
very peculiar looking metal. It looked like gold,
and stood all the tests for gold, but it was so soft
and mushy that his long experience told him it
could not be gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“His curiosity being aroused, he took his knife
and cut out a chunk, just as you would a piece of
butter, and carried it back to camp.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Arriving there he opened his package, when,
lo and behold, it had turned hard as a rock and
red as the prettiest piece of gold nugget you ever
saw.</p>

<p class='c012'>“More surprised than ever, he sent it to his native
city, New York, for examination.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The scientists there put their heads together
and decided that it was in every way better than
the original gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A company was immediately formed and the
metal was shipped to this country in large quantities.
Today, my friends, all kinds of articles are
manufactured from it. This little chain which I
hold in my hand is made from this metal, that is
known all the civilized world over as Asiatic
aluminum gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, a few words more and I am done. In
handing these out I wish to make an explanation.
I have only about thirty watches and thirty
chains, and if I were to hand them out right and
left promiscuously I would not have enough to go
around. Besides that, I might put some of them
in the hands of unscrupulous men.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So, in order to avoid that, and protect myself,
and have the watches go to people who are honest
and appreciative, I will put a very small price on
the chain, and nothing on the watch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you were to go to the jewelry store and buy
one of these chains it would cost you from three
to five dollars. Now, I shall not attempt to charge
any such price, but, to make a long story short, I
will put them down to the little, in-sig-nif-i-cent
sum of twenty-five cents. Remember, the watch
goes free, and the first man who passes me up a
quarter gets the outfit. Ah, there’s a man wants
a bargain, and he’ll get one, too. Here, sir, is
your change. Who’s the next lucky man?”</p>

<p class='c012'>All the time the quarters were rolling in I kept
reminding the people that there were only about
thirty watches and chains, though in reality I
would have been glad to put out an unlimited
number. When I was sold out I gave the
promised entertainment, and all went their several
ways rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus I traveled, and schemed, and fought for
fortune. If there was anything new on the wholesale
market I had it; and it was surprising what a
variety of articles for street selling I managed to
pick up. It is unnecessary to say that I handled
them clear up to the limit of artistic skill.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, after all, one gets tired of this sort of
thing, though I varied my schemes as often as I
thought I could make better money.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found, too, that what won one week was a
failure the next, and with even what seemed a
success the bank account which every fakir
yearns to have was slow to grow. For that reason,
when I seemed to have skimmed the cream
off one thing, I tried something else, falling back
on old schemes when it was necessary or profitable.</p>

<p class='c012'>Several times I organized medicine companies
and gave entertainments in the opera houses,
carrying along a physician with whom the public
could have free consultation. Several times I got
out of such schemes by selling good will and fixtures,
thus quitting them anything but a gainer.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, there were other lines to work,
and I tried them all, with the idea that one thing
was as good as another, and perhaps I might find
something a little better. When I discovered that
street selling seemed to be telling on my throat I
got back to canvassing again.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Selling Musical Instruments—Trickery
and Deception—Looking for Something
New—Selling the Roaster—The Canvass.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>I got to selling pianos and organs by the merest
chance.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was canvassing with a furniture polish, which
was really a very good thing, and one day went
into a store where musical instruments were sold,
hoping to do a stroke of business. I did, and a
very good stroke of business I made of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The dealer had some talk with me, apparently
liked my style, and finally offered me very good
terms to work for him a scheme he had in view.
He thought I knew enough about the instrument
to handle pianos successfully in the way he proposed.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had several Beatem pianos, which were
listed at a high figure, but which he had obtained
at a large discount. So far, he had been unable to
sell them, and as he was well known he did not
care to manage the fake he thought of suggesting
to me. He offered to fix me up in style, and pay
my expenses and big wages, if I would go to a
city not far away, representing myself as from
Beatem and attend to the disposing of a piano
through the Woman’s charity organization of the
town. I jumped at the chance, and went to Tirbyville,
splendidly dressed and in every way well
equipped for the scheme.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the piano had come I called upon the
president of the society and made known the fact
that I was representing the Beatem Piano Company
of New York; that their pianos were of the
finest kind, and that the firm had adopted a new
way of introducing them. Instead of paying big
money to the newspaper men, I had instructions
to give the benefit of all the profits to some charitable
association; in fact, I was in town for the
purpose of giving away some of them now. The
instrument was here, on exhibition and trial, and
what we wanted to do was to call attention to it.
At the same time, of course, we were more than
gratified at the chance of doing a little good. I
wanted to advertise the pianos, not to sell them;
and in order to hurry the affair through as
quickly as possible, I was going to offer special
inducements to those taking an interest in the
matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>I then stated that the instrument was worth
eight hundred dollars, and the best way to determine
its destination was to raffle it off at one dollar
per chance. I would have eight hundred
tickets printed, and the W. C. O. was to have
twenty per cent. of the proceeds for managing
the affair. As a still greater inducement for the
ladies to assist in the scheme for getting the piano
before the country, we intended to give a twenty-dollar
gold piece to the lady who sold the greatest
number of tickets, and ten dollars for the next.</p>

<p class='c012'>I knew the scheme could not fail. The ladies
took hold and worked like beavers, attending to
the sale of the tickets, and likewise to the drawing.
On my side I saw that an advertisement like
this appeared in the regular reading matter of the
local papers:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The finest piano in the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tirbyville enjoys the reputation of having
the finest amateur musical talent of any town in
the state, and Beatem Bros. of New York have
the reputation of making the best pianos in the
United States.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A representative of this firm is now in our
city with one of their samples. In order to introduce
their goods he will give away one of their
superb instruments.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It will be raffled off under the auspices of the
Woman’s Charity Organization, the tickets selling
for the nominal sum of one dollar.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The piano is a gem, costing eight hundred
dollars direct from the factory. It is now on exhibition
at Kirby Bros.’ music store, where the
musically inclined public is invited to call. Professor
S. James Weldon will be there at all hours,
ready to explain the merits of the piano, and our
citizens will do well to call. The worthy charity
organization reaps the benefit of the drawing, and
we trust our citizens will liberally subscribe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It took about six weeks to work up this scheme,
but it paid well. After deducting the twenty per
cent. commission, prize money and personal expenses,
I went away with about one hundred dollars
profit for my employer, who at once sent me
to another place to work the racket over again on
the same lines.</p>

<p class='c012'>I succeeded in exhausting his stock of Beatem
pianos in this way, largely to his profit, and fairly
to my own. When there were no more pianos he
tried me on organs, and I remained with him
quite a while.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes I disposed of the organs by the lottery
scheme, and sometimes canvassed through
the country to sell them outright. Either way I
made money out of the proposition.</p>

<p class='c012'>I remember that I once called on a farmer who,
I knew, was a close buyer. He had two buxom
daughters, who, besides feeding the chickens,
milking the cows, and churning the butter, found
time to play “Home, Sweet Home,” on the organ.
They had none of their own, and wanted one
awfully bad.</p>

<p class='c012'>I exerted myself to the fullest to make the sale,
but did not—until I was almost ready to throw up
my hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>As a last resort I succeeded by a bit of trickery.
I took out a piece of paper and began figuring on
it, remarking:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Farmer, I am going to figure on the actual
net manufacturer’s cost of this instrument,
and then I may be able to make you another proposition.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After figuring for a while I said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“This organ never sold under one hundred and
fifty dollars, but if you want it you can have it for
one hundred and twelve dollars and forty-five
cents. That is just about what it cost, but as I
don’t want to take it back to town with me you
can have it for that price. You consider the offer
while I am out watering my team and when I
come back give me your answer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that I started for the door, carelessly
thrusting the slip of paper into my pocket. Accidently
(on purpose) it fell to the floor, and I went
on without noticing it. Of course, he picked up
the paper and looked it over, seeing that, according
to my own figures, the organ cost just one
hundred and five dollars and fifty cents.</p>

<p class='c012'>Poor, unsuspecting man, when I came back,
thinking he had the drop on me, he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say, young fellow, I’ll give you an even hundred
dollars for that organ. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, I hesitated and talked a lot, but
finally gave in. The organ stood us, counting
freight charges and all, an even eighty dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>The greatest objection I had to handling musical
instruments was that the work was not sufficiently
“rapid and devilish.” I think I rather
preferred to handle organs, because I made more
sales, even if the profits were so much less on
three or four of them than on one piano. A hundred
dollars coming at the end of three or four
weeks was not as enticing as less money, coming
by closer installments.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a money-maker for me, but I eventually
grew tired of the business. There was too much
hard work in handling those large, heavy organs,
and besides the disadvantage of traveling in all
kinds of weather and putting up with inferior accommodations
in farm houses, made it more than
unpleasant. I drove into town one day determined
at least to take a little lay-off and figure
on something that would be more to my liking—perhaps
go back to street selling again.</p>

<p class='c012'>It generally happened that when I quit one
thing another showed up right at my hands.
Probably it was because I was looking for it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Quite accidentally I came across a canvasser. He
actually tried to obtain my subscription to that,
at one time, highly popular journal, The Weekly
Rooster, and if I had not been too much in the
same line myself I think he might have made it.</p>

<p class='c012'>We had quite a talk about the paper, from his
point of view, and I decided to try my hand at it,
for a time at least.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found more trouble in making arrangements
than I had anticipated. I would have to be
trusted to handle quite an amount of money, and
the firm required a bond or strong references.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had no references nor bondsmen whom I
cared to give, but I ultimately arranged by putting
up a cash deposit, and after quite a lengthy
correspondence, during which I was several times
tempted to throw up my hands, I secured sample
copies and a certified subscription book and went
to work.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “Rooster” was a twenty page illustrated
paper, the subscription price being six dollars, in
advance, per year. As special inducements, fifty-two
paper back novels—one with each issue of
the paper—were offered, and a set of six cloth
bound volumes. If preferred, however, they took
installments of fifty cents per month, and that
was the liberal proposition I principally worked
on. Very little trickery was necessary to obtain
orders.</p>

<p class='c012'>For my “mark” I first selected a well-known
individual, well up in public esteem; say, for instance,
a merchant of high standing. Walking
into his place of business I would say to one of the
clerks near the door, “Is the proprietor in?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir. Yonder is Mr. Denim.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent (walking up to the proprietor).—“Pardon
me, but are you Mr. Denim?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D.—“That’s my name, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I am representing the Weekly Illustrated
Rooster of New York and I want to put
you down for a year’s subscription.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D.—“Don’t want it. I’m taking too many
papers now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Let me explain a little. The former
manager of our paper died some months ago, and
while the matter was kept up to its former high
standard the business end was neglected, subscriptions
expired without any effort to obtain
renewals, and consequently half of our advertising
got away from us. Now, a new man has
taken hold, enlarged the paper, added new departments,
and is offering special inducements in
order to build up again. I am under contract to
get seventeen thousand new subscribers in this
state, and I’ll get them, if I have to give things
away myself and be discharged for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D. (growing interested).—“What sort of
a paper is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>When you bring a man into the confidential
history of a thing he at once begins to imagine
that in some way he must belong to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“It is a beautiful, clean, twenty paged
paper, illustrated, and with sixteen departments.
The news covers every form and condition of life,
with accurate and thrilling pictures of the passing
show. The bulk of the articles are of an editorial
nature, being instructive, interesting and
amusing. We have sixty-seven special correspondents
in all parts of the world, who contribute
regularly each week; and special articles are
given from the best known pens in the universe.
It is far above all contemporaneous sheets and
costs no more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D.—“How much a year?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Only six dollars.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D.—“Isn’t that a little high?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“It might be considered so for the
paper alone, but when you take into consideration
the fact that we give with each yearly subscription
the entire ‘Rooster Series’ of fifty-two
novels, by all the standard authors, books which
would cost you twenty-five to fifty cents at the
regular news dealers, the price is reasonable
enough, after all. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D.—“I’ll admit that it is a nice offer, but I
guess I’ll have to pass it by this time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“You are one of the pillars of the
town, and I hate to let such a good man go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D.—“There are plenty of good men here
besides me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Yes, I know; but not the same,
either. You are recognized as one of the leaders,
and your name heading my list would give me a
prestige.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D. (smiling).—“How do you know I am
one of the leaders?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I was told so by another prominent
citizen. I’ll tell you what I’ll do with you, Mr.
Denim; I will give you free of charge a set of six
elegant, cloth bound volumes, all standard works,
if you will subscribe for the paper. Of course,
this is a confidential proposition, for the sake of
obtaining your influence and to have your name
at the top of my list.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. D.—“All right, then. Put my name
down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This little scheme of tickling a man’s vanity
worked every time when the individual approached
had any vanity at all to tickle. As I
usually averaged ten subscribers every day my
profits ought to have been highly satisfactory—and
so they were for some months, and it was
only when there was a change in the liberal policy
of the Rooster, including the cutting down of
commissions fifty per cent., and also taking away
the premiums, that I thought it time to take hold
of something else. By this time I had a fair little
bank account.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had acquired the taste of canvassing for reading
matter, and from this on to reading matter I
stuck, save at odd times when I picked up again
almost any old thing and made it pay while I
looked around and drew breath. I believe my
next venture was in selling bibles, and I dropped
into it while corresponding with eastern houses
with a view to selling their books. While awaiting
developments in that line this new one came
to my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Selling Bibles—Selling Books—What
Was Said—Working the Customers—Curiosity—Public
Meetings and Library Clubs.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>It was altogether an accident that I ever got
into bible selling. I stumbled across a man who
was probably in many respects better fitted than
I to handle the business.</p>

<p class='c012'>Unfortunately for him, he was overtaken by
sickness, and I did him a favor in financial as
well as other ways when I allowed him for a time
to turn his employment over to me. Of course, I
went at it as a simple business proposition, and
brought to bear all my resources rather than to
lose a customer. They say if a man can’t use his
tongue he may as well shut up shop. As I never
had any difficulty in the former, I never was compelled
to do the latter for any other purpose than
temporary repairs. The agent told me what to
say and gave me all his business methods.</p>

<p class='c012'>The way I worked an ordinary sale was something
like this:</p>

<p class='c012'>After trying to lead my man into conversation,
I would spring the real subject of my talk quite
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, by the way, Mr. Smith, how would you
like to have a nice family bible?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Smith.—“A bible, eh? Oh, I have the old
bible that mother gave us when we were married.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Yes, I know. But we have a bible
that discounts anything you ever heard of. It is
a facsimile of an English bible that sells across
the water for forty-five dollars. We are only
charging twenty-two, and you pay only three dollars
a month, without interest. It is the finest
thing on the market today. Other publishers are
dying to get our secret, because we are selling at
less than it would cost them to manufacture the
same article.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Smith.—“Your bible must be a mighty fine
one to cost twenty-two dollars.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Right you are. In the first place, it
is printed on the very finest quality of white linen
paper. Its cover is a superior quality of Morocco
leather; the type is large and clean; the full-page
engravings are executed on steel in the finest
manner; it has the old as well as the new testament,
enriched with parallel references and a fine
biblical dictionary referred to in marginal notes.
In addition to all this, it has elegant blanks for a
marriage certificate, and a family record, together
with the illuminated Lord’s prayer and the ten
commandments, all on separate and decorated
pages. To cap the whole thing and to give this
bible a special ‘tone,’ there is a Swiss music box
in it which plays twelve different hymns. Every
time you open the bible you have the benefit of a
choir, and if you ever feel like staying home from
church just take down the good book, have your
little boy fall asleep by the fire, and you’ll have a
‘meeting’ of your own—psalms, hymns, services
and all. Why, man, it is the most complete and
beautiful thing of the kind you ever saw, and if
you don’t agree with me, on your honor, I’ll give
you fifty dollars.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Smith.—“Whew. You’re a long-winded
feller. I know that bible is fine, but I just haven’t
got the money for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“You’ll admit a good bible, clear
type, solid binding, spring back and up-to-date is
something every Christian household should possess;
and how often are you called upon to invest
in one? Once in a lifetime; and when you do,
you ought to buy carefully. A good bible is like
every first-class article. It pays for itself in the
long run, and the difference in price is always
well worth paying. Think of the satisfaction of
owning a genuine good article, that you will not
have to replace in a lifetime. Besides, it is a
staple ornament in a man’s home and speaks for
his morals and fear of the Lord—which, you
know, is the beginning of wisdom. Better let me
put your name down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Smith (hesitatingly).—“I ought to see
Maria first.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“This is the time you don’t want to
see Maria, because you want to surprise her. This
bible business is a new venture with us, and this
is my first trip out. But next trip I want to do
an immense business, and I would like to get a
book in here as a sort of an advance advertisement.
I’ll tell you what I’ll do. If you won’t say
a word about it to a soul, and will give me your
order, I’ll knock off seven dollars from the price
and make it an even fifteen dollars. And I’ll also
cut the payments to five cents per day—just one
little, round nickel every twenty-four hours—till
it’s all done and paid for. And I’ll tell you, my
friend, if I ever expected to be prosperous and
have what the world calls a run of good luck it
would be while I was buying a bible. What do
you say?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Smith.—“Well, that certainly looks fair
enough, and there’s a good deal in what you say.
I guess I’ll put my name down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Thanks, sir, thank you; understand,
the only reason I am giving you this bargain is
that I can refer others to you when I come around
again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Smith.—“Oh, yes, I understand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I know you have the best bargain
you ever made. My word is as good as law,
though, and I’ll not back out. Good-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That was the sum and substance of the argument,
varying it at all times to suit the occasion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Selling bibles was easy work, for the most part
carried on with good people, and at a good profit—it
may seem strange that I did not follow it
longer than I did. I thought it a little strange
myself. I do not believe it was superstition that
drove me out of the traffic, but if you were to
say that it was I might not know so well how to
answer you. Anyhow, I quit it and took up with
a general line of books.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the first place, this bible business was only
temporary, and done only to help the sick agent
out. Next, as stated in the previous chapter, I
had made arrangements for this line; and, third,
I knew there was better chance of making big
money in handling a line of standard authors. So
I quit the bible and paper and went to the miscellaneous
books.</p>

<p class='c012'>The firm I worked for published the complete
works of many standard authors. There were no
single volumes on my list, and if I remember
right the smallest set was a history of the world
in four volumes.</p>

<p class='c012'>As samples for canvassing the firm furnished
each agent with a nice stretcher, showing up the
backs of each set of books complete. These
stretchers, or book backs, were gotten up in a very
neat and tasty manner, and when set up against
the wall looked just like a complete set of the
books would appear when arranged in a book
case. I would walk up to a business or professional
man without giving him any advance
knowledge of what I wanted. In general, I
stated my business in a roundabout, though apparently
off-hand, manner, gradually leading up
to the vital point, finally saying to him:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going to get up a library club here
among the literary lights of the town and I want
you in it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer (pleased at the compliment).—“I
didn’t know that I was a literary light.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Oh, yes you are. You have distinctly
that reputation. In fact, I heard about you
before I came to town.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“Who told you so?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Why, two or three parties in M—.
up here told me to be sure and call on you. My
manager in New York also sent me a list of
twenty prominent people here, and your name was
among them. So, you see, you are known on the
outside as well as in your own town.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“I don’t see how you fellows find
everything out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent (jokingly).—“Oh, you know, ‘murder
will out.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“You are right there, but I don’t
understand what you mean by a Library Club.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I’ll tell you. It is a scheme that
gives you a chance of getting a library of your
own which will cost you virtually nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“I still don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I’ll explain further. You know that
it is the working for single customers, or hunting
them up and delivering, that makes the book
business so expensive. Quick sales and small
profits put quite a different face on the matter.
Now, here is a new edition of Roberts’ works in
twelve large volumes. It contains all the products
of this famous author’s pen, and is the only complete
set ever published. One set, regular price,
costs twenty-four dollars, but if I can get up a
club for twenty sets, in this town or vicinity, I’ll
cut the price right in two, prepay the expressage
and deliver them for twelve dollars. You can pay
for them in little monthly payments of say one
dollar and a half per month, and the entire set
delivered at one time and in advance. Did you
ever hear of a better offer?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“Well, it does sound pretty nice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“By the way, do you know anything
about Roberts’ works?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“I have heard of them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Roberts is now recognized as one of
the leading writers and a standard authority. He
was at one time a prominent officer in the English
navy, and in that capacity traveled all over the
world. His works are based on historical facts
and personal observation. He takes you into all
the different countries, and gives you more pointers
in history than any other living writer. He
also opens channels heretofore unexplored. The
beauty of Roberts is that he is instructive as well
as interesting. I tell you, he is fine, and no one
could appreciate a set of his works better than
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“I dare say, but I have a lot of
books now that I never read. I don’t get the
time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“My friend, even if you don’t read
yourself you will admit that a library is a valuable
addition to any home. You are in a position to
appreciate the fact, since you are a married man;
and as this proposition is such a fair one you
should not hesitate to increase your store. So far
as not having time to read—you are not supposed
to sit down and regularly read the edition
through. Skim them over, culling as you go, and
when you need a fact you know where to find it.
Jay Gould had a library of 83,000 volumes. Do
you suppose he read every one of them? The fact
is, while you prefer one thing your wife likes another,
and the children still prefer others. Every
one has his or her own individual taste in reading,
and that is where the advantage comes in having
an extensive collection. You know good reading
sharpens a man’s intellect and enlarges his knowledge.
Better let me put your name down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“Perhaps I will, but not right
away. You go ahead and see what success you
meet with and then come back to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent (undismayed).—“I’ll tell you another
good point about Roberts. His language is the
finest and purest ever placed on paper. Leading
newspapers all over the world have clippings
from Roberts. Lawyers in pleading their hardest
cases quote profusely from Roberts. His portrayal
of character is wonderful. When you read
from him you laugh one minute and cry the next.
Before you know it you are flying through the
air like a feather. His is high-minded, choice
reading in the fullest sense of the word, and ours
is the most elaborate edition published.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“Well, I’ll think about it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Did you ever read his Two Pirates?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“No, I think not.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“It is considered his masterpiece and
gives a history and a warning. There was once a
young man by the name of Judson. He belonged
to a fine old family, renowned for upright ways
and aristocratic lineage. For all that the young
fellow was disreputable and bad.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some of the members of the family, in order
to save themselves from being disgraced by his
actions, persuaded him to join the navy, and he
was placed on board a frigate commanded by a
certain Captain Shortliff.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Judson was no sooner on board the vessel
than his rogue’s nature began to show itself. He
conceived a sudden ambition to become a bold
pirate, and concocted a scheme to murder all the
officers, take command of the vessel, turn it into
an ocean rover, and kill and plunder on the high
seas.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He found among the crew plenty of willing
hands to join him in the conspiracy, and it was
settled among them that those who would not
agree to come under the black flag were to be
quietly murdered and their bodies thrown overboard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The scheme was about ripe for consummation
when it was discovered by Captain Shortliff.
Judson and his first lieutenant were placed in
irons, while the principal officers of the frigate
held a consultation concerning what course it was
best for them to pursue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was decided that the best thing to insure
the vessel’s safety was to hang the two rogues,
and this, accordingly, was done.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two months later, having arrived at headquarters,
the captain gave himself over to the
naval authorities, reporting the fearful adventure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He was court martialed, but later on it was
decided under the circumstances he could have
taken no other course, and the court fully exonerated
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Based upon these facts, General Roberts, who
was a personal friend of Shortliff, wrote his most
realistic novel. Now, don’t you think you would
like to read all about the “Two Pirates?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“The story is extremely interesting,
but—you’ll be around again, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“No, I never make a second call on
the same man. You know the old saying, ‘Never
put off till tomorrow what you can do today.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“Oh, there are a great many old
sayings. We don’t have to follow them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Well, then, laying all jokes aside,
I’ll tell you what I’ll do. You can’t blame me for
trying to get business when there is an opportunity
in sight. If you’ll give me your order
without any more labor, I’ll cut the payments to
twenty-five cents per week. You see, our regular
payments are one fifty a month, but I’ll just
put it down to one dollar. That will give you a
whole year to pay in, without any interest. Of
course, I wouldn’t want you to mention it; but
I’ll do it, just to make sure of a quick sale. I
know if I can once get started I can hold you as
a good customer in the future.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Customer.—“Well, I guess I can stand a quarter
a week. Put my name down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>By asking at the outset payments of one dollar
and a half per month I had room at the last to
drop to one dollar. If, in the beginning, a man
ordered a set, payable at the rate of five cents a
day, I at once imagined him to be a good mark,
and endeavored to sell him three sets at ten cents
a day, or three dollars a month. I made more
money in selling books than anything else I ever
handled, and was awfully glad I tumbled into
the business. I found from experience in this line
that it was the easy terms that made the sales.
With most people the only evidence of prosperity
is the ability to buy, and as all desire to be prosperous
they are willing to accept the nearest evidence
in sight and buy what they can.</p>

<p class='c012'>Along with the sales of books on the installment
plan I sometimes worked the rackets known
as the “Free Reading Room” or “Library Club”
schemes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking a town of moderate size I would solicit
subscriptions from all the prominent men. For
every dollar subscribed I would place in the reading
room four volumes, which they were at liberty
to select from a catalogue I carried.</p>

<p class='c012'>I argued that a free reading room was a good
send-off on the outside, and would also be a good
thing for the town in a social way. I managed to
arouse much enthusiasm, and usually had from
two to four hundred dollars on my list as a result
of a couple of weeks’ work. Then I would turn
the books over to some charitable institution or
a committee and go on my way rejoicing, with a
neat little sum in my pocket.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the larger towns I organized library clubs
among the young folks, charging three dollars
for a membership. With every membership secured
I would put in from six to twelve volumes
of standard works. If it was necessary to get the
thing started in good shape I would call a meeting
of the young people and pass around small
envelopes. Those holding blanks had to pay for
their memberships, but there would be a few
holding lucky numbers, and they were entitled to
join free of charge. At this meeting, guided by
my experience, a regular library and social club
would be organized. I would then collect my
money, again being the winner by a good majority.
In both of these schemes the books furnished
cost me, on an average, twelve cents apiece.</p>

Felt Better and Was Better—Selling
Encyclopedias—Complete Canvass—Tricky
and Persistent—Advertising Schemes—Tricks
of the Present Day—Disguises—How
Different Business Men Were Worked—Strategy.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>Having found a general line of books so profitable
to handle, it might be supposed that I would
have stuck to that, and not experimented with exclusive
work in a single line. I reasoned, however,
that a large commission, made just as easily
and rapidly as a small one, was a great deal better
for the bank account, and so I finally switched
off from the general line to the selling of forty
dollar encyclopedias. While engaged in this work
I made better money, came in contact with a better
class of customers, looked better, felt better
and was better in bodily appearance and mental
condition than I ever was before; and what was
far better, I was able to put by and hold on to a
far greater portion of my earnings.</p>

<p class='c012'>In soliciting for encyclopedias I used a horse
and carriage, and made a thorough, systematic
canvass of every town visited. I first called on
the ministers, then the other professional men, including
the school teachers, winding up with all
the business men that would or could buy.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is my canvass, word for word, as it occurred.
Walking into a store, I would say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you Mr. Rice?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Yes, sir; that is my name.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“You are the proprietor, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Yes, sir, I am.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“My name is Weldon; I am representing
the Banner people of New York.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“In what line?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Selling their new encyclopedias. I
understand you are quite a reader, and I thought
I would drop in and see if I could not interest
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Times are too hard to buy encyclopedias.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Yes, I know times are hard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Besides, I am not fixed to take care
of a set of that kind. I could not possibly afford
it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Certainly, if you don’t want them I
won’t insist, but—you know what they are, don’t
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Oh, I guess so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“And if you had a set in your library
you would certainly appreciate them, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Of course, I would appreciate them,
all right, but there is no use of talking. I can’t
even think of buying them now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Suppose, Mr. Rice, that in the face
of all your excuses, I should give you a chance to
get a set for virtually nothing, do you think I
could interest you? That is a pretty strong question,
but I mean it, every word. I am getting all
the best people in town, and I was told to call on
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R. (growing attentive).—“Why, of
course, if they didn’t cost anything I would take
a set. But I will bet you are not traveling over
the country for your health.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I do not mean that I will absolutely
give a set away, but almost so. Give me half a
chance and I’ll make you an offer that will do
your soul good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“What is your proposition?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I want to explain a little before I
make my proposition. You see, this is a new edition
of Banner’s, brought right up-to-date. The
company advertised extensively and, figuring on
doing a big business, got out seventy thousand
sets. This late financial crash happened, and it
came near knocking us clear out. It don’t pay
to keep the stock on hand, and pay taxes and insurance,
so we are going to try and force them
out, quick and cheap. Now, I’ll tell you what we
are going to do. The regular price of a set is
seventy-two dollars, but we have cut that right
in two, making it thirty-six. If you order you
get the complete set at once, free of expressage,
and only have to pay fifty cents a week on them
until they are paid for, nothing in advance, and
no interest. If that is not almost giving them
away I don’t know what is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“I’ll admit that is a fair proposition,
but I don’t think I can accept it today.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“It is a good idea for a man to be conservative,
but sometimes it is policy to deviate
from the regular rule. If you will sift this offer
down to a fine point, take every particle of it into
consideration, and compare these books with
other encyclopedias, you will acknowledge yourself
that even if things are not just exactly as you
would like to have them, it is worth while taking
hold of anyway.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Why do you claim that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“For various reasons. In the first
place, the total cost for so good an article don’t
amount to a hill of beans. Even if you paid it all
down at once you wouldn’t feel it, let alone paying
for it in such little dribs. It is virtually nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Yes, but I have too many of these
little dribs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I don’t care how dull times are,
how economical a man is, how many irons he has
in the fire, or how many obligations he has on
hand, there are always little incidental expenses
during the month that are met without a murmur.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Even if I bought the books I would
still have those outlays.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“You are right, but I want to ask you
one question. You make up your mind now to
practice economy. If you were walking down the
street and felt like drinking a glass of lemonade
or smoking a cigar wouldn’t you go right in and
spend ten or fifteen cents for the luxury?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Yes, certainly, if I felt like it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“You play billiards and pool occasionally,
do you not?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Yes, frequently.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“And you sometimes lose the game—one
can’t always win?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“I am no expert; I often lose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“If some ladies were to come in here
now, soliciting for a church charity, you would
dig up a couple of dollars without a struggle,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Yes, but it’s policy to do that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“So I acknowledge, but I am just illustrating
how money goes. If you felt like
dropping in at the theatre you wouldn’t stay away
because business was a little slack. You would
take your wife and go to the play and enjoy the
evening, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“I do that frequently, but, then, one
must have a little diversion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“That is what I mean by incidental
expenses—little matters which bob up without a
word of warning. We feel called upon to meet
them whether business is good or bad, and in the
long run scarcely miss what they have cost. In
fact, we don’t allow them to bother us. Now,
look at this. Here is something you can be proud
to have in your home. Your entire family will
enjoy and appreciate it, and it will be a fine addition
to your library, which would really be incomplete
without it. Consider my proposition
critically. You will hardly miss the fifty cents,
and before you know it the books will be all paid
for. It is the prettiest offer ever made.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Oh, I know that, but I hate to obligate
myself now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Why, sir, it’s too little a venture to
be afraid of. Think of what you are getting, and
how you are getting it. It is just like going to the
dentist to have your teeth filled. You dread the
idea of sitting in the chair, but when it is all over
you are awfully glad you have had it done. So
with this encyclopedia. When you once get it,
and have seen its full merits, you will wonder
why you ever hesitated.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“But I really have no time to read.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“My dear sir, an encyclopedia is not
made to be read like a newspaper or a novel. Its
value is as a book for reference. If you have occasion
to look at them only once a month it will
be worth all the price you pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Come to think of it, a friend of mine
has a set. I can use his when I need them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“But that is not like having a set of
your own. For that matter, you could ask your
neighbor to show you his clock, so you could see
what time it was; but that is not like owning a
clock. You could also borrow your neighbor’s
newspaper, but it is not always wise nor convenient
to do these things. You cannot always
have them when you want them most. Take, for
instance, a cold, wet, wintry night, and you at
home by a nice, good fire, with wife and children
gathered around you. Would you care to leave
this cozy room and go out into the stormy night
to your neighbor’s library?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Well, no. I guess I will speak to my
wife and let you know this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Mr. Rice, that is not business. You
know your wife would like the books, and you
also know you do not want to be bothered again.
Your time is too precious, and so is mine. You
can tell me right now as well as this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“I want the volumes bad enough, but
I must have time to consider.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“In order to make you safe I’ll tell
you what I’ll do. I will send them to you with
the distinct understanding that if your wife don’t
appreciate them you can have them for nothing.
Is not that fair?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“That is fair enough—can’t you come
again?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I just want to show you the advantages
of this offer and then I’ll go. In the first
place, take the Blewtanical encyclopedia. It costs
from seventy-five to one hundred and fifty dollars.
Dippleton’s costs from seventy-five to
ninety-five, and Judson’s, eight volumes, costs
fifty-six dollars. The Monarch, in six volumes,
costs sixty dollars; and the Mercury, in nine volumes,
forty dollars; while the Peerless, the smallest
standard encyclopedia, and only in three volumes,
costs thirty-eight dollars. Now, mine is in
twelve large volumes. It is four years later than
any of the others, has all their merits, and more
new features than all the rest put together. It is
recognized as the standard edition all over the
world, and I am offering it to you for less money
than you can buy the cheapest of the others, and
on such terms that you cannot afford to miss the
chance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“But are not the others just as good?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Perhaps—as far as they go. I am
not running them down, understand. One of our
greatest presidents was once addressing a literary
society on the subject of books. Speaking of this
class, he said there were no words strong enough
to tell the merits of a good encyclopedia. Of
course, if you bought any of those other editions,
you would be getting good books, but they are a
few years behind and cost so much more money.
It is just like putting six coats of paint on a house
when two will answer the same purpose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“How is it you can sell yours so much
cheaper than the others?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Because we are satisfied with larger
sales and smaller profits. Our work is in no way
inferior to the others; in fact, all authorities consider
it superior, and my terms are so reasonable.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“I should think you were taking big
chances.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“That is the very reason we interview
reliable parties only. Formerly, when one bought
an encyclopedia, paying a fancy price for it, he
would have to give a mortgage on house, business,
wife, children and almost everything he possessed.
He’d have to sign promissory notes with
a judgment clause, and you know what that
means. He would have to pay ten per cent. interest,
pay for expressage, and receive only one
volume at a time. Under this proposition you
don’t sign notes, you pay no interest, no expressage,
make no advance payments, give no security,
and get the complete set of twelve volumes
at one time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“How do I know that you are telling
the truth?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I am surprised at that question.
Don’t the thing look fair, right on the face of it?
I offer to ship you a complete set, free of charge,
and then give you one whole year in which to pay
for them. Just think, my dear sir, could I afford
to make misrepresentations on these conditions?
You are a business man, and so am I. Do you
think I’d sell you one thing and ship you another?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“And you say it is a very late edition?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Yes, sir, modernized and right up
to date.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. R.—“Any maps?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Certainly, sir. One hundred and
nineteen maps, 13,000 illustrations, 17,000 pages,
57,000 separate and distinct subjects, 16,000,000
words, and an atlas department which represents
every country in the known world. This department,
by the way, is more extensive than any
single atlas. It takes you into every spot on the
face of the earth, from the diamond fields of
Africa to the orange groves of Florida. It also
gives a biographical sketch of all the notables of
the various nations, something no ordinary atlas
does. The whole encyclopedia is complete in
every department. It gives the origin of every
language, the history of the world’s religious and
political developments, origin and growth of secret
societies, manners and customs of all nations,
treats broadly of architecture, mechanism, arts
and science, taking you into a thousand channels
heretofore unheard of. The illustrations are the
great drawing card. In the department of mechanics,
for instance, if you read the description
of an article and do not understand it, you could
turn to the illustration and see it, plain as daylight.
Besides all these features it has an extra
department, giving all the speeches made by our
leading politicians during the late campaign.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R. (jokingly).—“But I can’t read.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“You don’t have to, Mr. Rice. This
is the parrot edition. Just open one of the volumes
and it speaks for itself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“I have a dictionary. I think I can
make that do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“For heaven’s sake, man, don’t compare
an encyclopedia to a dictionary. One is a
collection of words only; the other a complete
compendium of subjects. In fact, the encyclopedia
is both, combined in one. A dictionary
gives you no information except on single words.
There is absolutely no comparison.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“But I never take time to read.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“You can’t make me believe that. The
life and push of our country come from men who
read. The hustlers who get to the front are men
who read, and all solid business men are well
posted. Now, you are one of the solid business
men of the town, and I know you could not be
where you are unless you were well informed. I
can tell the educated man the moment I see him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“You are getting along too fast. I
don’t pose for an educated man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“I should hate to call you a prevaricator,
but they say around here that you are a
great bookworm, and where there is smoke there
is sure to be a little fire.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R. (feeling complimented).—“How are
your books bound?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“In fine Russia leather, gilt-edged.
They are designed for first-class libraries only.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“And the collections?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“You can remit through the banks.
The First National will be our agent here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Shall I remit weekly?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Agent.—“Oh, you can drop your fifty cents in
a cigar box and send it in once a month. With
business men like you that is all right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R.—“Well, I might as well take a set now
and be done with it. I see you will stick to me like
a porous plaster to a lame back until I do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If I had gone through the entire argument
after this fashion with every purchaser I would
not be alive now. Thank goodness, they were not
all quite so hard on a fellow as Mr. Rice; and yet,
when I began canvassing in the book business, do
you know who I practiced on? The toughest customer
I could find, one who was able to buy, but
from whom I felt certain I would not get a red
cent.</p>

<p class='c012'>I would argue on the good points of the work
I was selling, and do all in my power to get an
order, even though nine times out of ten I failed.
Of course, when I got through I was terribly
wound up, but I knew that my time had not been
lost. I found out the weak points of my argument,
and on the second customer I could correct
my errors. I would keep this up for several
days. It gave me good, practical experience, and
in a short time I had a canvass strong enough to
face anybody, and success followed me like a
tramp does the odor of a good dinner.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found that it paid to advertise. On coming
into a town I would visit the newspaper offices
and pay for little personal paragraphs, announcing
my arrival and stating my business. This
served to introduce me. By reading the following
samples you will see that I desired to impress
the people with the belief that I was a man of
great importance, and I generally succeeded. The
Stormville Banner, for instance, would say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. S. J. Weldon, representing prominent
publishing houses in New York, is in the city,
having arrived last night. During his stay he will
endeavor to interest the literary people of Stormville
by introducing the latest edition of Banner’s
encyclopedia, of which 70,000 copies have been
sold. He makes a most novel proposition, and
ought to be well received and do a flourishing
business. Mr. Weldon bears the enviable reputation
of being the most successful agent in his line
in the United States and Canada, his sales so far
this year footing up to the enormous sum of over
five thousand sets.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is another:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Prof. S. J. Weldon, the gentleman who is with
us this week selling Banner’s encyclopedia, recently
wagered one hundred dollars with a gentleman
of Hilt City, which town is twice as large
as ours, and where he sold seventy sets, that he
would be equally successful in Stormville. Which
will win the wager? That depends on which of
the two towns prove the more appreciative.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This advertisement I used when I came across
two rival towns. It worked up a patriotic excitement
and assisted greatly in making sales. Another
effective article read as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Prof. S. James Weldon, president of one of
New York’s largest literary clubs, arrived in the
city last evening. He furnishes the new edition
of Banner’s encyclopedia and will call on our professional
and business men in the interests of that
magnificent work. Afterwards he will organize
here a branch club of his parent society, the object
being educational advancement and social intercourse.
Gold prizes will be given the members
making the best progress, and twice a year the
local assembly will be represented at the grand
lodge by two delegates. Once a year the grand
lodge takes a tour around the world. Prof.
Weldon was one of the party the last trip, and
says they were royally entertained by their foreign
friends. He will, in a few days, call a private
meeting of our leading citizens and address
them in the interest of the enterprise.” This ad.
always gave me a wonderful prestige.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the present day the publishers take a larger
hand in scheming than formerly, yet the principal
methods remain much the same. For instance.
Books are advertised at a high price, but at the
same time an offer is made to place a few sets
with certain leading citizens at a greatly reduced
figure. No information is given in regard to
terms, but prospective purchasers are invited to
write for particulars. Those letters of inquiry
are sent to agents traveling for the house, and one
of them drops into the town and tells Mr. Customer
that he has made a special trip from New
York or Chicago to see him personally. In the
interview the agent brings all his batteries to
bear; broadsides, mostly loaded with flattery,
are poured into the victim’s ear, and generally a
sale is landed. The neatest dodge I have ever
seen is one originated by a Chicago firm. Coupons
are given to the amount of the purchase,
which are good at certain stores for ten per cent.
of the price of any article purchased there, such
an arrangement having been made with the merchants
who are in the field to draw custom. If a
man buys a fifty dollar set of books the company
gives him fifty dollars worth of coupons. He
buys, say five dollars worth of goods. He would
pay four dollars and fifty cents in cash and fifty
cents in coupons, thereby in the end virtually getting
his books free. If the merchant would stand
that the customer surely could.</p>

<p class='c012'>Canvassing in the larger cities is very hard
work, more so than in the smaller towns. So
many of the office buildings have a sign hung up
like the following:</p>

<p class='c012'>“No Agents or Canvassers Allowed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I have worked such places in the garb of an express
messenger, and though the janitor may
have suspected my visits were unduly long he
gave me no trouble. I have used the clerical uniform,
both in such places and in small towns, with
good effect. When I visited a town that was a
railroad division point the garb of a railroad man
suited me to a charm. I would pose as an eastern
railroader on a lay-off, making a tour of the country
and canvassing to help out.</p>

<p class='c012'>In working the smaller towns I found that a
rumor circulated to the effect that I was a foreign
detective on the trail of some noted criminal
was of great assistance. It would work a sort of
undercurrent in my favor and give me prestige
with a customer I otherwise could not get. It
was really amusing at times to watch the crowds
whispering to each other and sizing me up as I
walked down the street. The thought of having
a real live detective in their midst would always
arouse their curiosity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus, in selling books, and especially encyclopedias,
I varied my canvass to suit my respective
locations.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found that I had to be constantly on the watch
to adapt the method of my approach to the nature
of the individual. One man had to be taken by
storm; another would surrender only after the
slow process of a long continued siege. With
some I made a strong argument upon subjects
with which they were not supposed to be intimately
acquainted; with others I had to call attention
to the very points which they oftenest
touched in their every-day life. With lawyers I
had to confine my remarks a great deal to legal
questions and debates; with doctors, to medicine
and surgery; with ministers, to theology and the
sciences and it was generally safe to ply a school
teacher with such things as art, poetry and the
classics, or a newspaper man with matters of general
information. For merchants I had a little
song about free trade or tariff, income taxes, imports
and exports, the price of grain and the like,
and to mechanics, blacksmiths and builders I
talked of machines and materials. Again, there
were others who seemed to want to get away as
far as possible from the grooves in which their
own lives were running, and these people I had at
a decided disadvantage unless their range of
reading was a great deal wider than that of the
average of their class.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is an instance of my manner of approaching
customers:</p>

<p class='c012'>I would walk rapidly into a man’s office, as
though it was the place I had been looking for all
the time. I would state that I was directed to
him as a gentleman well versed in literature and
learning, and as that sort of sympathy was what
I desired to meet in my business I thought I
would run in as I was passing by, see him, introduce
myself, and promise him a call by and by.
Then I would start for the door, but stop as I
turned the knob, make some suggestion in regard
to his being considered authority on literature,
start for the door again, and draw him into questioning
me, asking me of what books I was speaking,
and the like. Then I was safe. If I could
get a man who was able to purchase to ask me
questions, and then listen to what I had to say, I
was reasonably certain of a sale.</p>

<p class='c012'>A man who can buy, and won’t buy, is like the
bird that can sing and won’t sing. If you can once
get him interested, and continue the argument
without in any way exciting his anger, he can be
made to buy. In handling a hard customer I
found it a good plan sometimes to continue talking,
without giving him much chance to say a
word. I paid no attention to the objections he
offered, knowing that in most cases they were of
no weight with him, but only made as a pretext
to get rid of me. I just kept on with my argument,
and pretty soon he would be apt to come to
time and think perhaps I was talking sense after
all. If I felt him slipping through my fingers I
talked all the harder, until, perhaps, the man
would give me an order for the sake of my pure
audacity and to get rid of me.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sensitiveness was a quality I absolutely discarded,
substituting what some people would call
cheek and gall of the purest and most unadulterated
grade.</p>

<p class='c012'>Did I always make people buy? Well, not always;
but with fair subjects at least two out of
ten would succumb, and in the encyclopedia business
that would mean big money for a working
day.</p>

<p class='c012'>As a rule, a man is less easy to sell to than a
woman. A woman is more accustomed to buying
just as she has the money and opportunity.
A man usually makes up his mind in advance,
goes at his leisure to some local merchant and
makes his deliberate selection. An agent drops
in on him when all thought of making a purchase
is far from him. There’s the rub. I might have
to go around such a man cautiously for half an
hour to get him interested.</p>

<p class='c012'>To do so successfully his curiosity must be
aroused and his attention fixed. I would ask him
if he had ever heard such and such a passage in
a certain story. Then I would quote some very
beautiful and touching extracts, or comical ones,
which would make him laugh. In some way I
started him in a desire to see the books. Then I
was safe.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the most pitching part of all my arguments
was where I used flattery. If given in the
right place and in the proper proportions, like the
axe and the chicken, it always reached the neck.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not always easy for an agent or canvasser
to gain an entrance to a private house, unless he
uses some trick or wile to fit the occasion. Usually
I found it the best plan to leave a sample volume
at my first call, never offering to go beyond
the door, and stating to the lady that it was for
her husband to look at, but it would be a gratification
if she would examine it herself. If the
book excites the least interest the way will be
opened for a subsequent call. I have appeared at
the door, when my ring was answered, as just
drawing a big bunch of letters from my pocket.
Accidently dropping two or three of them on the
porch, I would politely ask the lady of the house
if I could not assort them on a table. Believing
that I had one for her she would invite me in. I
was the inventor, I believe, of the envelope addressed
to “the lady of the house,” but I always
had my little sample package, or nicely printed
table of contents, addressed to the lady personally.
Having gained an entrance, I presented this and
then stated my business, finding little trouble in
securing an audience.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once, when I was trying to sell some books to
a man, I had him interested, as I thought, but
could not close the deal. While talking to him he
pulled out his pipe and prepared for a smoke.
Taking a cigar from my pocket I said, “My
friend, try a twenty-five cent cigar.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The thought of smoking a twenty-five cent
cigar pleased him. He took it with a smile; the
weed did the work; I got the order. After that
I always carried a few good cigars in my pocket.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another time I remember going into a place of
business and telling the proprietor I had just come
from Hartsburg, his former home—I posted myself
on the points before calling—and that while
there I had met General Ball, who sent his regards.
He had requested me to call and show his
old friend what I had so interested the people of
Hartsburg. In fact, he had given me a note of
introduction—here I fumbled unsuccessfully in
my pocket—but it seemed to have been mislaid,
over which I appeared to be very much distressed.
But I went through my canvass all right. I had
gained the man’s attention and sold him a set of
encyclopedias.</p>

<p class='c012'>A great many of the people would put me off
until I came around again. With a general line
of books I could use the closing out racket or the
fire sale dodge. With encyclopedias I had a different
story, explaining, perhaps, that this would
be my last trip under present conditions. Before
I could come again the international copyright
law would go into effect. The last congress had
passed a law whereby a copyright in another
country held good in this, and when the law began
to operate there would be a cash royalty of
sixty per cent. to be paid on all copyrighted
works. We had thirty thousand sets on hand and
to avoid this large outlay on royalty we were
going to unload a large portion at the mere cost
of production, and by taking advantage of my
offer now there would be a saving of one hundred
per cent. This was always safe, because the international
copyright law has been talked of for
a hundred years, and today not one man in a
thousand has any accurate knowledge of what the
law amounts to, or how it affects the publishing
business.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alertness once got me an order for the most
expensive and finest edition of the Banner encyclopedia.
I approached a Mexican gentleman of
education and wealth, but his manner was such
that I had little hope. Incidentally, I asked his
name. It happened to be the same as that of a
noble Mexican general, whose biography was
given in the book. I called his attention to the
fact, and suggested that they were branches from
the same family tree. Perhaps they were. At
any rate he thought so and ordered a set with an
eye to having the recorded history of his genealogy.
So much for knowing what was in the books
I sold.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Rebuffs and Insults—The Lawyer, the
Doctor and the Coon—Avoiding a License—Working
the City Marshal—Jokes with
the Milliner—Banking Twelve Thousand
Dollars.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>I do not care how careful and polite a man may
be, he is always bound to meet with occasional insults.
I found the three classes who were most
apt to be insulting were those who were in
straightened circumstances, those jealous of the
prosperity of another, and those who were by nature
rude and devoid of average sense. I always
tried to confine my calls to the better class of people,
and for that reason met with few insults,
though I would occasionally drift into the wrong
channels. Sometimes I gave as good as I got,
and if I stretched the truth a little my conscience
did not smite me so long as I felt I had gotten
fairly even.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once I dropped in on an attorney, who was
actually doing nothing but smoking a cigar and
reading a paper covered novel. After I had introduced
myself and was stating my business he said
bearishly: “No, I don’t want your books.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But—” said I.</p>

<p class='c012'>“See here, young fellow,” he interrupted without
giving me a chance to talk, “I don’t want you
to bother me. That’s the trouble with you fellows.
You just bore the life out of a man. Get
out of here as quick as you can.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that he pointed to the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, sir,” I said, “I will go. But I did not
come up here to sell you anything. I wanted to
engage an attorney in a matter that involves a
great deal of money. One of the large concerns
in your city is about to fail. My brother, who is
a jobber in Chicago, has a claim against this firm,
and, as I was coming here, he telegraphed me to
look after it. I was advised to call on you, and
came in with the intention of giving you the case.
I am glad I found you out in time. I certainly
would not throw a thousand dollars into the
hands of a man too ungentlemanly to allow me to
state my business.</p>

<p class='c012'>All the time I was speaking he was rubbing his
hands together in an excited manner and was
ready to apologize, but when done I walked off as
rapidly as I could. To this day he is probably
regretting the loss of a big fee. I hope so, and
that it made him more polite in the future.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shortly after this I called on a colored grocer
of the name of White, who was busy with some
customers when I entered. Looking up he asked
me what line I was in, and I told him, “The Banner
Encyclopedia.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” he said, in a smart-Aleck tone, “I don’t
want your ’cyclopedy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I have a special proposition to make and
will drop in again when you are not so busy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look heah,” he answered, “yo’ needn’t come
ag’in; I kain’t wase no time on you fellows, and
I wouldn’t buy books from an agent nohow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am not selling books, sir,” I replied. “I am
getting up an encyclopedic directory of prominent
business men. But excuse me, Mr. White, I
didn’t know the proprietor here was a colored
man, and as we don’t care to have niggers in our
directory I’ll not bother you any more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This last remark cut him deeply, but he had insulted
me and I felt I had a right to answer him
back. I think I showed him the difference between
a colored gentleman and a nigger, if he
never knew it before.</p>

<p class='c012'>At another time I called on a physician, and
when I explained my business he said to me with
a pitying smile:</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you are selling books, eh? Well, young
man, you have my sympathy. You are the most
useless article to be imagined, and you don’t seem
to know it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sympathy to the devil,” I exclaimed, angered
more by his manner than his words. “Look
at me and see if I need your sympathy. Here am
I, with a fine tailor-made suit, a fifty dollar overcoat,
patent leather shoes, diamonds all over me,
traveling over the country, stopping at first-class
hotels, having a good time and making money
hand over fist. Does that look as though I needed
your sympathy?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” I continued, “here you are, wearing a
baggy pair of pants with fringe at the bottom, a
shabby coat and vest that are old enough to vote,
and a slouch hat that is not fit for a dog to wear.
You sit in a little dingy 2×4 office, waiting for
some sucker to come in and give you a dollar for
a prescription. You eke out a miserable existence
and see no real living at all. You are the
man who needs sympathy, and I assure you, you
have mine from the bottom of my heart.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that I left him, too thunderstruck to
answer me back. Of course, my talk to him was
not business, but it was a heap of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have already touched on the matter of license.
Notwithstanding I carried that decision of the
United States supreme court in my pocket, I
found that in some places the marshals were inclined
to enforce some miserable city ordinance,
without paying attention to the rulings of the
higher powers. As I canvassed one day and delivered
another, the most of them had to acknowledge
that I was not selling outright, nor peddling.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes I thought it better to make arrangements
to do my business through a local firm. By
mentioning this fact to the chief of police and the
license inspector I was generally allowed to go
unmolested.</p>

<p class='c012'>I recall one experience in which I avoided difficulty
with a bull-headed official. It will serve as
an example of methods sometimes used.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went to an express office to get some samples
my house had sent me. The agent, seeing that I
was a canvasser, gave me some pointers on the
license question. He told me he was once in the
same business and wanted to put me on my guard.
I would find the new city marshal an obstinate
fellow, who could not be worked. He was a regular
old crank who would show no mercy to canvassers.
I would either have to take out a license
or run my chance of being arrested. As the license
was so high as to be practically prohibitive
the chances of doing business without a lawsuit
did not seem encouraging.</p>

<p class='c012'>Well, I thanked the agent and then worked the
town without paying any license. How did I do
it? This way:</p>

<p class='c012'>Learning the marshal’s name, I called upon
him, introducing myself as the representative of
a well-known eastern paper. I explained that I
was writing up the country, and that this city was
considered one of the most enterprising places in
the state. I also stated that he was recognized
as one of the most prominent citizens, and that I
had stopped off on purpose to get his biography
for publication.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was tickled to death and smiled an 8×10
smile. I touched up his vanity all through the
conversation, and got his history from the time
he left the cradle until he landed in the city marshal’s
chair—and it made mighty good reading
when I wrote it out. I’ll bet his hat didn’t fit him
that night.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I finished the “write-up,” I conversed
with him a few moments on general topics, and
then said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the way, Mr. Marshal, my house is turning
out a new encyclopedia in twelve volumes. Do
you think I could do any business here in that
line?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He said the best way was to try. I explained
all about the encyclopedia, stating that I only
called on the upper ten, because they alone appreciated
the best books. We usually only made the
larger cities, but this was such a metropolitan little
place I thought I might get enough orders to
justify a shipment and to pay the expense of the
write-up I was making. Would he kindly give
me the names of the most prominent people?</p>

<p class='c012'>He not only gave me the names, but told me to
go ahead; that no one should bother me. I made
one hundred and seven dollars in that town, and
went away with as large a smile on my face as
the one the marshal wore while I was writing up
his life.</p>

<p class='c012'>I also found it a good idea to be supplied with
a stock of jokes which could be used to fit almost
any occasion. I had a natural sense of the ludicrous,
anyway; and if I came across anything in
the comic papers which might be of value I did
not hesitate to salt it down for future use. As
an instance of application, the following:</p>

<p class='c012'>I dropped into a millinery store after an order
for the encyclopedia. When I had spoken for a
few moments to the proprietress, telling her that
the book was full, complete and unabridged,
treating of every subject that could be known or
mentioned, she asked me jokingly if it had any
good cooking recipes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, certainly,” I answered; “I’ll read you a
few of them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I have heard that the female sex are deficient in
the sense of humor, but the milliner laughed
heartily at these jokes, which happened to be new
to her, and signed the contract for a set without a
struggle.</p>

<p class='c012'>Virtually I was in the book business for over
nine years, in which time I handled scarcely anything
else.</p>

<p class='c012'>You may be sure I was acquainted with every
wile and artifice of the trade. I had traveled all
over the United States and Canada, visiting all
the principal cities and interviewing the governor
and other officers in each state and territory. I
had crossed the continent, from the Atlantic to
the Pacific, thirty-two times. For years I seemed
to have success without a break, and I dreaded no
more of being “busted.” All the time my bank
account was growing, and in one year of prosperity
I banked twelve thousand dollars in clear
cash while selling encyclopedias.</p>

<p class='c012'>How was that for a fakir? I will not say that
I was tired of the life; but it began to look as
though, like Alexander, I had no more worlds to
conquer. Was it a wonder or was it not that I
found I could go a step farther?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Real Estate Fake—Booming a Town—Making
a Fortune—Tricks of Other People—All
This World Is a Fake and Every
Person in It a Fakir—The Politician and
the Widow—A Diamond Ring for Two
Cents.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>“Almost twenty years in the faking and book
business. How times flies; and yet I have gained
enough experience in those twenty years to last
a lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So I mused one day while tilted back in my
chair in front of the “Ashland” hotel, the principal
house in a western town, which perhaps you
may recognize under the name of Buxton.</p>

<p class='c012'>I remember, as distinctly as though the time
was yesterday, all the surroundings of that little
town. The place was on the eve of a boom, and
the best informed were in a fever of excitement
over its prospects. I took out my bank book and
looked over its pages.</p>

<p class='c012'>No. The past ten years of my life had not
been wasted. Each succeeding page showed a
record of profits and gains, even though it was
only when I switched from street selling and the
like to the handling of a general line of books,
and a little later on to the exclusive traveling in
the interests of the Banner encyclopedia, that fortune
seemed really coming at my command.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had then what was a fair little fortune laid
by. Of late years I had been always a winner,
and felt sure that I could carry the “Banner” successfully
for many years to come. Even in the
little bits of speculation in which, more for the
sake of diversion than profit, I had been engaged
success had invariably crowned my efforts. Why
should I not launch out more boldly? I believed
I saw a chance to make thousands in the time I
was taking to make hundreds, and without the
possibility of any great loss. And if I did lose,
what matter, since I had strength and experience
through which I could soon recoup myself?</p>

<p class='c012'>The speculative fever had me, and sitting in
that up-tilted chair I decided to hit the game for
what it was worth before the fever rose with the
rest of the world to its full height, thus giving
me the best chance to be in shape and ready for
the crisis. I bought a piece of land adjoining
Buxton and had it cut up into building lots. I
sold them all when the boom came for twelve dollars
each. The deals were managed by local real
estate agents, and after paying them their commission
I found that on an investment of four
thousand dollars I was six thousand ahead. Having
bought at the right time there never was any
danger that I would lose; while, as I had expected,
I came out a handsome winner.</p>

<p class='c012'>This speculation encouraged me to dabble in
real estate on a larger scale. I realized that it
was not like the old days when one waited for
years while the land slowly grew into value, but
that with smart, far-seeing heads at the front fortunes
might be made in a single night. I looked
over the map and kept my ear to the ground,
waiting for another favorable opportunity.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found it at Harwood, where I bought several
sections of land, which I cut up into town lots,
holding them, at the outset, at thirty dollars a
lot. As before, I had local land agents interested,
who, seeing big money for themselves, assisted
me in all kinds of schemes to boom the property.</p>

<p class='c012'>They built—on paper—three railroads, a magnificent
union depot, machine shops and factories,
an opera house, and a line of street cars. There
was in reality as fine a bit of water power at Harwood
as one would want to see, and the site had
other advantages. We got the attention of the
people of the state turned in that direction by advertising,
hired a job lot of engineers to survey
for the three railroads, and got as far as to start
the foundation of a two million dollar college.
The street car lines were brought to the attention
of eastern capitalists, who own the franchise to
this day. Outside people put in money and then
came to look after it. One of the railroads was
actually constructed, and another broke ground;
the water power was turning the wheel of a real
mill; a handsome court house stood in the public
square; there was a hotel or two on Central avenue
fit to grace any little city; there was a population
that had risen from four hundred to four
thousand, and more coming, and every evidence
of prosperity, when I sold out my last lots. I had
already seen some of my thirty dollar lots go up
to three hundred, while the poorest land owner in
the original town would have made a fortune if
he had held on long enough. But I knew how to
quit and when to quit. With a hundred thousand
dollars to the good I retired gracefully, and before
the turn of the tide. There were plenty of
persons in after years to say, “If Weldon had
stayed with us the boom would not have collapsed.”
But Weldon did not stay. I knew it
was only a question of time when the inflated
values would take a tumble, so I stood from under
and lost not a dollar in the wreck.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since this successful venture I have been in
numerous speculative deals, and the quality of
being ever on the alert, acquired while faking in
different capacities, has stood me well in my later
career. I have always felt to a moment how long
it was a sure thing to hold on, and have never
been caught in a crash. Perhaps I have at times
been too conservative, but I tell you, gentlemen,
there is nothing like playing on velvet.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to the methods by which I made my fortune,
I have no desire to offer an excuse for them,
and yet a few words may here be in order, to call
attention to the fact that there are other fakirs in
the world besides the man who travels with microscopic
look-backs and goldentine pens. Before
the reader undertakes to criticise me harshly
let him look and see what is done every day in
channels of “legitimate trade.” I admit that I
practiced trickery during my years on the road,
but I claim that any man is justified to use it in
gaining his point, providing he does not misrepresent
merits and gives value received. Show me
the man who has not the ability to draw customers
to him, or sense to employ business tact and
trickery, and I will show you a man who will
never amount to much in the world. His brethren
in the trade are using them every day, and they
are the ones who succeed.</p>

<p class='c012'>If a merchant advertises a special sale, and
gives you a yard of calico for three cents which
cost him five, does he not throw out a leader to
lure you into his store so that he can sell you
something else at a profit? I remember once,
walking down a business street in a large city, I
saw twenty dummies in front of a clothing store,
each of them cased in an overcoat of extra fine
material. Hung to each one was a large placard:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“Special Sale of Overcoats Today.</div>
    <div>Your Choice $4.98.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>I picked on one I thought would suit me and
went inside to buy it. When I told the salesman
what I wanted he said, “Those goods on the outside
are not in the special sale; but here are the
$4.98 coats,” and he pointed to a pile of inferior
garments. Of course, they caught customers by
the scheme, and was it not trickery?</p>

<p class='c012'>Once I asked a preacher who was managing a
church fair why it was they talked so strongly
against lotteries and gambling, and then had so
many schemes of chance at their fair, and so many
of the young ladies working among the boys to
catch their little ten cent pieces. He replied that
without special features of some kind a crowd
could not be drawn and the effort would end in
failure. Isn’t this trickery?</p>

<p class='c012'>Do not understand me to be against the preachers.
I am now a member of the church and an
earnest advocate of religion. I am simply showing
up the true side of life and human nature.</p>

<p class='c012'>Is there any bigger grafter for fees than the
average lawyer or doctor? Go into his office and
before he will name a price he will size you up
and soak you accordingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once I shipped a crate of picture frames to a
town, the shipping agent telling me the rate was
fifty-three cents. When I came to pay at the other
end the rate was one dollar and six cents. The
freight clerk told me that when shipped at owner’s
risk the rate was fifty-three; otherwise it was one
dollar and six cents. Was not that trickery—and
robbery besides?</p>

<p class='c012'>Did you ever see a more unprincipled trickster
than the average politician? Here is an illustration.
In a certain county of a great state there
were two candidates for the nomination for the
office of county superintendent of schools; one, a
man without a family; the other, a widow lady
with two children. They were about equal in
strength and it was uncertain which would win.
The man, wanting to get his opponent out of the
way, made her the proposition that if she would
withdraw and support him, and he was elected,
he would make her his deputy and divide the proceeds
of the office equally between them. She
accepted and gave her whole time to the campaign.
After the election he tried to ignore her
entirely, swore that he had never entered into
such an agreement, and on top of that circulated
all sorts of scandalous reports concerning her.
The poor woman took all this so to heart that she
committed suicide, throwing two orphan children
upon the world—and they were girls at that. Was
not that the worst kind of trickery, treachery,
knavery and hypocrisy? I call it murder in the
first degree.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once, when I was in the west, I stopped at the
only hotel there was in the town, the proprietor
being also a banker. The hotel made me a rate of
ten dollars a week, and at the end of the seven
days I tendered a draft for twenty-five dollars,
which I had received from my firm that morning.
The banker claimed I could not be sufficiently
identified and refused to cash my paper, but
agreed to send it in for collection. He kept me
there three days, waiting for money, and at the
end of that time charged, in addition to the ten
dollars for the week, two dollars per day for the
extra three days, and seventy-five cents for collection.
Now, wasn’t that robbery as well as
trickery? I knew he had “worked” me, for he
could not send the draft to New York and get returns
in three days.</p>

<p class='c012'>In North Dakota there were two undertakers.
One was poor, the other rich and owner of the
only hearse in town. A poor man’s wife died.
He found that he could buy a coffin at the smaller
establishment for a great deal less than from the
other. He ordered it, but when he called to make
arrangements for the hearse the proprietor would
not let him have it, because the coffin was not
bought at his place. The poor man was forced to
go to the next town and procure a hearse. That
seems even worse than trickery.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a large concern in Chicago which advertises
to send you a one hundred dollar diamond
ring for a two-cent stamp; and they do it,
too. Here is the way the scheme is worked: An
agent of the company sells you a ticket or coupon
for one dollar. You send the ticket and nine dollars
in cash to the firm, which in turn sends you
ten other coupons. You sell these coupons to
your friends for one dollar each, thereby getting
your money back. Your friends must each do the
same as you did, selling their coupons to their
friends. As soon as your friends send the money
they have collected you get your diamond, and
when their friends do likewise each one of your
friends gets his. So, you see, while the company
is paid for the goods sent out, each man actually
gets a hundred dollar diamond ring for a stamp.
Now, isn’t that up-to-date trickery? It is a sort of
endless chain scheme, and is actually being carried
on by a responsible firm in Chicago.</p>

<p class='c012'>A great many times in my travels I have noticed
that the Salvation Army are particularly
fond of holding meetings in front of those hotels
which are most patronized by traveling men. The
reason is obvious. They have an eye for the collections
they invariably take up, and there is not
a more cheerful giver on earth than the traveling
man. I remember once seeing the Army collect
twenty-eight dollars in front of a certain hotel,
and then march up the street and work the next
one. I do not censure them; I approve of their
work, but I say this is trickery just the same.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the worst things in the line of trickery
and fraud is the system of paying in scrip by certain
corporations. These companies have their
own stores, and in order to force the men to buy
at them they pay wages in scrip, which is virtually
only an order for goods at the company concern.
Is not this an outrage? Officers and managers
who are honored and respected wherever
they go have the men work like slaves, and instead
of paying in cash give them a due-bill, good
in trade alone, and only at the company store at
that. By going through a lot of red tape, waiting
perhaps three or four weeks, these due-bills can be
cashed at ten per cent. discount. That is the best
that can be done. Usually the laborer needs his
money and thinks he is lucky if he can find some
member of the company who will cash his order
individually and on the spot at a discount of
twenty-five per cent. Again, I call this robbery
and trickery combined.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I first landed in San Francisco a hack-man
led me to believe that he was a hotel runner
and created the impression that I would get a free
ride. All houses there run a free bus. When I
reached the hotel he charged me two dollars.
Without a kick I paid it, as I might have known
better than to trust him.</p>

<p class='c012'>In another city I noticed a case filled with a
beautiful line of photographs. The following
sign was in the center:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“These Elegant Cabinets Just</div>
    <div>$1.00 Per Dozen. Come Up and Have</div>
    <div>Your Picture Taken.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>You go upstairs and after the operator gets his
camera fixed on you he tells you, by the way, that
the photos are $1.00 per dozen unmounted; if
you want them put on cards they are two dollars
a dozen. Now, who in the world would want
photos unless they were mounted on cardboard?
If you don’t put up the two dollars you get no
pictures.</p>

<p class='c012'>An enterprising restaurant man put a sign in
front of his place, advertising “Ham and eggs at
ten cents. Beefsteak and potatoes ten cents, including
coffee, bread and butter, etc.” You go
in to eat and on the bill of fare printed in very
small letters you find the following: “All single
ten cent dishes twenty cents; all twenty cent
dishes twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I have seen instances on the road where hotel
proprietors send their porters to the depot to yell
at you when alighting from the train, “Free bus
for such and such a hotel.” When you ride from
the depot to the hotel the ride is free, but when
you go back from the hotel it costs you twenty-five
cents. I know of hundreds of hotels that
charge their transient trade two dollars a day and
their local patrons three dollars a week. Every
traveling man on the road will tell you this is
true. Some landlords even seem to go beyond
this. I knew of one who was fond of getting up
raffles, on perhaps a watch or a diamond ring, selling
tickets only to transient customers. The
raffle never came off, though this landlord would
always claim that it had, and give the name of
some fictitious person as the winner. I am glad
to say that he was eventually sent to the penitentiary.</p>

<p class='c012'>I could spend hours in calling attention to incidents
like the foregoing, but what is the use?
You can see, and you must know, that everybody
is looking out for number one—every move,
every thought and every word uttered seems to
have a selfish motive back of it. You must look
out for yourself, or go under for sure. A great
author once said that all the world is a stage, and
all the persons in it merely players. He might
have said, “All the world is a fake and all the persons
on it merely fakirs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Draw your own conclusions, then, from what
I have written. Call me an unvarnished liar if
you will, a dissembler, a hypocrite, a cheat, a
dead-beat, what you like. To the untutored masses
a successful fakir may seem to be all of these.
You think his occupation is simply skinning the
public. I know that his largest triumphs are in
giving every man the full value for his money,
and yet securing good profits for himself. Reconcile
the two if you can; I did it long ago. Whether
you succeed or not, if these pages have furnished
you fair amusement I will be content. For no
other reason were they written.</p>

  <h2 id='ch20' class='c011'>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Married and Settled Down—Retired and Happy—A
Dip in the Lake—The World Is
Round and Wide—Farewell.</span></p>
<p class='c014'>In this narrative I have given a clear, comprehensive
view of a fakir’s life, as I saw it in my
own experience. I have made it no better and no
worse, but just as I found it. In the years that I
followed the calling I had many ups and downs,
yet, on the whole, was constantly advancing. Before
I had been at it long I accepted temporary
difficulties as a matter of course—unpleasant
while they lasted, but certain not to be of great
duration. Before long I grew to have the most
utter and complete confidence in myself, and
faced the problem of the hour without a doubt of
success. If I ultimately quit the road it was because,
though still a young man, I could retire
“with all my honors thick upon me.” In other
words, I was fixed for life, if I chose to spend my
days in idleness. That I subsequently added to
my wealth by other means was nothing against
my success as a fakir. Indeed, I am rather inclined
to believe that the boom at Harwood was
the greatest fake of all.</p>

<p class='c012'>After that, as I have already explained, I kept
my eyes open for good things, and when they
came along I caught them.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day when time was plenty on my hands I
got to thinking:</p>

<p class='c012'>“How old are you, old boy?” I asked myself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thirty-eight,” came the answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thirty-eight. Is it possible?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Yes, there was no denying it. Time had slipped
along and I scarcely noticed it going.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then,” I said, “it seems high time you
had a home of your own. There is something
more than life at the hotels and boarding houses,
in spite of its freedom. You ought to marry and
settle down. You have a good income and could
support a wife not only comfortably, but in
luxury.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps I was jesting with myself while talking
in this strain; but very soon I got in sober
earnest, and began to believe I had made up my
mind to become a benedict.</p>

<p class='c012'>I ran over a list of my lady friends. I knew a
vast number of them casually, but was surprised
to find with how few I had taken time to become
more than incidentally acquainted. The list was
not long, and I did not remember a single one that
I would care to make my partner for life.</p>

<p class='c012'>Should it be Sally Jones, Martha White or
Jane Smith? Gertie Thompson, Maggie Brown,
Annie Dawson, Kate Jackson or Lizzie
Moore? They all had their good qualities,
or I would not have been apt
to give them more than passing notice; but they
had their defects, and having noticed them I argued
that I had less interest in them than a man
should have in a lady he expects to make his wife.
I considered further.</p>

<p class='c012'>Are the objections serious enough to stand in
the way? Let me see.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sally Jones has red hair, and probably a bad
temper must be under it. Martha White has a
host of relations, and I might be expected to
marry all of them; otherwise, she might do. Jane
Smith is afflicted in the same manner. Gertie
Thompson is mild-eyed and even-tempered, but
hasn’t enough spunk to take her own part—she’s
too good for me. Maggie Brown has a tyrant of
a mother, whom I could not endure for a mother-in-law,
and four young lady sisters who take after
the maternal pattern. Annie Dawson and Kate
Jackson are beauties, but are too full of frivolity
and coquettishness, while Lizzie Cleopatra Moore
(that is her full name) is broad-shouldered and
masculine in build, and has pronounced views on
the equal rights question.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. None of these ladies have the qualities
I wish my wife to possess.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But who else do I know?</p>

<p class='c012'>“By jove, I have it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Miss Mattie Higbie, of course; the girl I made
the subject of my first and only practice as a corn
doctor. I owe that girl something for what I
made her suffer, and if she lives, and is single,
and seems to fill the bill, I’ll make honorable
amends by offering myself in payment of the
debt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>How I came to think of her is a question. After
all these years my remembrance of her was but
hazy; yet in the intervening time I had more than
once thought of her, and the promise I had made
myself that I would some day see her again. I
had never chanced to be in her neighborhood,
however, and her life since I saw her was a sealed
mystery.</p>

<p class='c012'>Would she remember me? Would she cherish
an abiding hatred for the clumsy corn doctor
who had once given her so much pain? No, that
was hardly probable. I must have changed too
much in the intervening time. When she saw me
I wore no whiskers, and, in fact, was little more
than a beardless boy, fairly disguised to act the
part of a man. Now, a heavy brown mustache
shaded my upper lip and side whiskers altered the
expression of my face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t wait,” has always been my motto, and
was the one I used on this occasion. The preparations
I had to make were few and simple, though
I might be starting for a visit that would extend
over months.</p>

<p class='c012'>I did not disguise the fact, however, that this
might be the greatest wild-goose chase of my life.
Why should I imagine that Miss Mattie Higbie
had remained single through all these years, or
that I would care to claim her if she had? That
she had changed greatly was to be expected, and
it might be I was preparing myself for a greater
shock than I was aware of. Well, time should
show. I might as well be doing this as anything
else, and it cost no more. I traveled in a Pullman
through lands I had once viewed from brake-beams
of a box-car, or the platform of the blind
baggage, and possibly the same negro porter
touched his hat and whisked off my clothes who
had once shied a brick at my head.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet in the place itself there was not so much
change, but when I debarked from the train it
seemed I had been there but yesterday. The same
buildings, neither more nor less dingy, the same
crowds thronging up and down the streets, or
lounging idly on the same corners. So it looked,
and when I sought out the hotel where I had once
stopped there seemed to be no change either. I
was half afraid to go in for fear the landlord
would recognize me and whisper the lynchers
would be on hand that night.</p>

<p class='c012'>I might have saved myself all trouble on that
score. The house had changed hands, had been
refitted on the inside and was quite an up-to-date
hotel. I registered and found myself at once very
much at home. The next thing was to find out
something about Miss Mattie, and here I was, for
the moment, at a loss. I did not care to mention
her name until I had a clearer idea of what
would be my course of procedure, and concluded,
for a time at least, to trust to chance and my own
resources. As a preliminary, I took a stroll out
to the Higbie cottage. The house was there, but,
alas, it knew the Higbies no more. Some other
name was on the door, and for the moment I half
fancied that all trace of my affinity was lost. I
paced back towards the hotel, a sadder and a
somewhat uncomfortably wiser man.</p>

<p class='c012'>But was there ever an hour when luck was not
with me? As I sauntered through the business
portion of the city my eyes fell upon the sign:
“John J. Higbie, Real Estate and Insurance. General
Solicitor for the Stromboli.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I had never heard of John J. Higbie before,
but you may be sure the name sounded familiar.
I turned into the stairway and mounted the steps
as though this had been my goal from the first.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found Mr. Higbie in his nicely furnished
office. He was a well preserved veteran of the
civil war, straight as a dart, keen as a sword, and,
withal, as fine a specimen of the southern gentleman
as I wanted to deal with. He also bore unmistakable
evidences of prosperity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Without hesitating I opened my business. I
had a few thousands loose and was looking for a
safe little investment, which would give me business
interests in that vicinity. If things pleased
me I might have more to invest when I had explored
the ground. We talked business for an
hour, and in that time I hardly thought of Mattie
once.</p>

<p class='c012'>As I rose to go I remarked that his name,
though not a common one, sounded very familiar,
and asked if there were any more families by the
same name living in the vicinity?</p>

<p class='c012'>No; he and his daughter Mattie were the only
representatives there of the family.</p>

<p class='c012'>With that I knew I was on the right track, and
took my leave. All things can come to the man
who waits, and I was willing to enjoy my suspense
for a little longer. I went away with a
strong feeling of satisfaction. It is true I had put
myself in line for making a deal of some thousands
of dollars which I had never thought of two
hours previously, but what of that? The investment
looked on the face of it as though it might
be a good one; and, anyhow, if I could find Mattie
it would be cheap at two thousand dollars—profit
or loss. I was already just that far gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>To make a long story short, I was on the right
track. When I mentioned to other people that I
was transacting some business through Major
Higbie it was not out of place to follow with a
casual question about his family. In that way I
learned that Miss Mattie was a very popular lady,
who presided over her father’s house and table
with dignity and grace. If she had never married
it was not for want of opportunities, but because
probably the right man had not yet come.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank heaven,” said I to myself, “The right
man is here now, but he was a long time coming.
The next thing is to arrange a meeting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Major Higbie did that, I had not yet closed
the original trade proposed, but in his mind I was
surely destined to do it, and was now talking of
other deals. The major invited me to his house
to take supper and talk matters over. That was
the way I met Mattie the second time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jove! How handsome she looked. There were
the same big blue eyes and the same tawny hair
piled high on her head, but she had matured into
a beautiful and glorious womanhood, which I
could only wonder at and worship. Thinking it
over a little later on in the evening, I could not
help but wonder that neither father nor daughter
had apparently noticed my confusion, and I
breathed a prayer of thanksgiving that I had not,
as I was on the eve of doing, blurted out, “I am
a corn doctor, selling corns, bunions and ingrown
nails.” I had rallied after that first bit of confusion,
however, and we three passed a very pleasant
evening. I was rich enough to feel satisfied;
had traveled all the country over, and selling encyclopedias
had been a liberal education of itself.
When I went away I knew I had made a favorable
impression and was proud of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The rest was a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, I never closed the land deal with
the major, but I led him to think he would eventually
catch me.</p>

<p class='c012'>The days drifted along into weeks, and the
weeks into months. I lived at my hotel, but had
the run of the Major’s house. Mattie and I became
almost inseparable, and I think I had a
pretty good idea of what the answer would be
when I laid my heart and fortune formally at her
feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>Five weeks later we left for the north on our
wedding tour, and the first place we made any
lengthened stay was at the old homestead, where
I had passed the first years of my life. The old
folks were still alive and welcomed us with open
arms.</p>

<p class='c012'>Prosperity had been with them as well; but,
alas, they showed too well the ravages of time
and the marks left by labor. They were aged
even beyond their years, while for Mattie and I
time had seemed to stand still.</p>

<p class='c012'>We went to “meeting,” now held in a beautiful
little church, instead of the old school house. The
boys I had played with in my youth were there,
grown into men, many of them old before their
time. When I looked around I could see in every
bent back, knotted hand and furrowed brow what
I might have grown into, and shuddered. Father
probably understood my thoughts, for on the way
home, when I told him what money I had made,
he said, “I am not sure, Jim, but perhaps you are
right. At least I can see what you might have
done had you stayed on the farm. And, Jim, your
wife is charming.”</p>

<p class='c012'>One day while in Chicago I said to my wife:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mattie, do you remember the circumstance of
a man calling on you a number of years ago who
said he was a corn doctor and the awful mess he
made in treating your foot?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do I remember him?” and her wrath seemed
to rise at the thought. “I should say I do, and I
would like to treat him—with—a dip in the lake.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, throw your husband in,” I said, looking
her straight in the face; “I am that corn doctor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was so surprised at my answer that she
could not say a word, but sat staring at me with
wide open eyes. There we sat for some moments,
looking into each other’s faces, until both broke
into a long and hearty laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>All this occurred some years ago, and I don’t
think my wife has altogether overcome the desire
to give me a dip in the lake. At any rate, if I ever
happen to displease her she says she thinks the
time is surely coming to carry out her threat.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am now a happy and prosperous man. My
family enjoys all of the comforts and many of
the luxuries of life, and the sound of the wolf
growling at the door is only a distant echo, reminding
me that once at times I was destitute,
and that I should not forget those who are unfortunate
now.</p>

<p class='c012'>What more could a reasonable being ask for?
No more, I am sure.</p>

<p class='c012'>As I said in my introductory remarks, this book
is written with a view of showing the inner workings
of a successful fakir, as well as to amuse
those people generous enough to peruse its pages.
I hope it has kept within its range.</p>

<p class='c012'>The world is round and wide, and on its surface
is found all kinds of people. Some take to
this and some to that occupation. All have not
the same inclination, and therefore we should be
generous in our thoughts towards those who do
differently from us.</p>

<p class='c012'>In his way a blacksmith is as good as a doctor,
a hod carrier as good as a merchant, a clerk
as good as his employer, a cobbler as good as a
lawyer, and a fakir as good as a statesman. The
president of the United States is no better than
the poorest man who helped to elect him.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have all equal chances to lose or make, as
we ourselves show our capabilities. If we were all
started from one point, on a road leading to some
goal, we know by observation that some would
falter and fall by the wayside, while others would
go straight on to their destination. We see all
this daily.</p>

<p class='c012'>But some of those who fall are persevering
and rise to their feet, saying, “I will win; others
have done it.” Making a great effort, they start
on their journey again, sometimes overtaking
those who have been in the lead. These are the
kind of men who make a success of their business,
the men who take for their motto, “Never say
fail.”</p>
